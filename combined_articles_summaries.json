        "summary": "Photo by Sydney Sims on\u00a0UnsplashLet\u2019s face it, talking about mental health can feel\u00a0awkward. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression alone affects over 280 million people globally. Mental health is a critical component of overall well-being, significantly impacting individuals\u2019 personal and professional lives. A staggering number of employees worldwide experience mental health issues, with conditions like depression, anxiety, and burnout taking a toll on individuals and organizations alike. Employees experiencing mental health problems are more likely to miss work, with a significant economic impact on businesses. A study by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) found that mental health conditions cost U.S. employers more than $200 billion annually in lost productivity. As a leader, creating a supportive environment where employees feel comfortable discussing their mental health is\u00a0crucial. This article has got you covered. It outlines ten essential strategies to help you build a mentally healthy workplace. 1. Create Safe\u00a0SpacesEstablish open and inclusive channels for communication. Encourage team members to share their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or repercussions. This can be achieved through regular team meetings, one-on-one conversations, or designated mental health check-in sessions. 2. Listen to UnderstandEffective leadership involves active listening. Show genuine interest in your team members\u2019 experiences and perspectives. Avoid interrupting, and instead, focus on understanding their emotions and needs. This demonstrates empathy and builds\u00a0trust. 3. Act with Kindness and CompassionCultivate a culture of kindness and compassion. Treat employees with respect and dignity. Recognize and appreciate their contributions, and offer support during challenging times. Small acts of kindness can go a long way in fostering a positive and supportive work environment. 4. Avoid AssumptionsRefrain from making assumptions about someone\u2019s mental health. Everyone\u2019s experiences are unique. Instead of making judgments, ask open-ended questions to encourage open dialogue. This demonstrates respect and understanding. 5. Respect and Reassure\u00a0PrivacyEnsure confidentiality when discussing sensitive topics. Reassure employees that their personal information will be treated with the utmost care. This builds trust and encourages open communication. 6. Listen Without Offering SolutionsSometimes, people simply need a listening ear. Instead of immediately offering advice or solutions, focus on actively listening to your team members\u2019 concerns. Validate their feelings and let them know you are there to support\u00a0them. 7. Offer ValidationAcknowledge and validate your team members\u2019 emotions. Let them know it\u2019s okay to feel overwhelmed, stressed, or anxious. This helps to normalize mental health struggles and encourages open communication. 8. Be Mindful of Your\u00a0LanguageChoose your words carefully when discussing mental health. Avoid using stigmatizing or insensitive language. Use inclusive and respectful terminology to create a supportive environment. 9. Follow\u00a0UpDemonstrate genuine care by following up with team members who have shared concerns about their mental health. Check in on their well-being and offer additional support if needed. This shows that you value their mental health and are committed to their overall well-being. 10. Educate\u00a0YourselfStay informed about mental health issues and resources. Attend workshops, webinars, or training sessions to expand your knowledge. This will equip you with the tools and information needed to support your team effectively. By implementing these strategies, leaders can create a workplace culture where mental health is prioritized and employees feel supported and empowered. What else would you like to add\u00a0here?",

The restaurant first opened almost exactly 5 years ago on July 25, 2019. \nChef/owner Christian Hayes shared a statement, which in part reads, \nTo say we have been submerged in an education about life for the last five years is a drastic understatement, and to say we are the same humans we were when we started couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. This journey has been both the absolute definition of the best and worst of times, and an education in not just business but mental health, physical health, expectations, pressure, failure, and success. \nThe last year has been brutal for so, so many reasons, and for the first time the actual struggles which usually hide within our spreadsheets and behind our facade has spilled over to our dedicated staff and it is not okay to continue on when we struggle to meet payroll and pay bills. \nHayes concludes with, \nIn the end, we are so proud of what we built, along with our incredible team beside us, and we know that our home on the river has made a nest of core memories and experiences that will carry on after the last plate is cleared. Thank you all for making this so much more than just a place to eat. It\u2019s literally been a dream come true. \nHayes shared that he will be consolidating his efforts into his other businesses Dandy\u2019s Handy (website, instagram) corner store\u00a0and Thoroughfare (website, facebook, instagram) \u201cand the endless potential to focus solely on creating food and restoration for our community around us through such a special spot.\u201d \nHere are a few photos from The Garrison back in 2019.",

Watch out, Alphabet: SearchGPT is on the way.   \u00a0 \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today's News \ud83d\uddde\ufe0fMichael Bay is bringing Skibidi Toilet to Hollywood TikTok creators can (finally) upload their own custom thumbnails Inside the NBA and WNBA's $20 billion deal with Amazon Prime Call Her Daddy takes fans to Love Island  \u00a0 THAT SKIBIDI RIZZ Prepare yourself for Michael Bay's Skibidi Toilet film adaptationThe phenomenon: Skibidi Toilet\u00a0is the moment. Since skyrocketing to popularity last summer, the lo-fi online series has won the title of YouTube's #1 trending topic of 2023 and climbed to a total of 65 billion views across platforms.   Now, Transformers director Michael Bay is ready to turn Alexey Gerasimov's world of warring toilets-with-heads and tech-faced soldiers into both a TV series and a major motion picture.  How it started: Gerasimov\u2014aka the animator behind Skibidi's home channel, DaFuq!?Boom!\u2014first joined forces with Bay in May, when creator/producer matchmaker Invisible Narratives\u00a0partnered with Bonkers Toys to develop Skibidi Toilet merch. By then, Bay (who serves as Invisible Narratives' Chief Creative Advisor) had already been tracking Gerasimov's work for some time. In fact, the director says he's followed the Skibidi creator \"since his early days when he was uploading fan-made Transformers videos.\"   Fast forward to July, and Invisible Narratives execs say multiple product lines are now in the works\u2014not to mention a movie/TV franchise \"similar to the Marvel universe or Transformers.\"  The big picture: It's hard to overstate the enormity of that development. Over the last few years, major streaming services and studios (including A24) have picked up creator properties like VivziePop's Hazbin Hotel, RackaRacka's hit Talk to Me, and Chris Stuckmann's upcoming Shelby Oaks. A project spearheaded by a director with Bay's prominence, however, stands to lend creator IPs more legitimacy in the public eye than ever before:  \"This is as real as any franchise that we've ever been involved with. It's still storytelling. It's still character development, it's still jokes and action and drama and intrigue. It's just a different delivery mechanism.\" \u00a0Adam Goodman, Invisible Narratives CEO & Former President of Paramount Pictures  \u00a0 \ud83d\udd06SPONSORED \ud83d\udd06VidSummit is the insiders-only creator economy event you've been waiting forFrom September 3-5, top creators like MrBeast, HopeScope, Marissa Hill, Colin & Samir, and MatPat will converge in Dallas for one exclusive event: VidSummit 2024.

Thumbnail designers gotta be happy about the added job security. (Tubefilter) \u200b The U.S. Senate has officially passed its first piece of AI legislation. The new law\u2014called the DEFIANCE Act for short\u2014will empower victims to sue creators, distributors, and collectors of nonconsensual deepfake pornography. (Gizmodo) As the U.S. presidential election approaches, X's AI chatbot, Grok, has reportedly begun spreading misinformation related to ballot deadlines. (Engadget)   WhatsApp just hit 100 million monthly active U.S. users, with a full 10% hailing from Texas. (Engadget)  \u00a0 BALLIN' ON A BUDGET Amazon Prime Video just signed a $20 billion deal with the NBA and WNBAThe billion-dollar deals: The NBA and WNBA just dropped a $76 billion announcement. On July 24, the leagues revealed rights deals with Disney (which will pay $2.6 billion per year), NBC ($2.5 billion), and Amazon ($1.8 billion).   According to the Washington Post, Amazon will air Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night games, while NBCUniversal's Peacock will broadcast Monday night games and NBC will offer Sunday/Tuesday night games and the All-Star Game.    The NBA and WNBA already have a relationship with Disney (which owns ESPN and ABC). Its partnerships with NBC and Amazon, however, are new\u2014and TNT isn't happy about it. The network had exclusive air deals with the NBA since 1989, but wasn't able to extend its contract beyond 2025.     TNT's parent company, Warner Bros, believes it should have been given a chance to match Amazon's deal, and is reportedly considering filing a lawsuit to argue its case.  Industry context: As Warner Bros' potential suit demonstrates, Amazon is the big winner here. Alongside weekly regular season games, the streamer has claimed global rights to air NBA playoff games, NBA conference finals, the WNBA postseason and finals, and a hodgepodge of other cups, championships, and games.   There's a reason Amazon entered the bidding war for that sweeping deal, which includes rights to sell the NBA and WNBA League Passes\u2014an offering similar to the NFL Sunday Ticket that YouTube snagged rights to in 2021: Professional sports still gets views.    The 2023 NBA Playoffs averaged 5.47 million viewers per game, making it the most-watched playoffs in five years.   Digital sports media has become an increasingly lucrative field over the past few years, with streamers like\u00a0Netflix\u00a0vying to fill the power vacuum created by cable's decline. Amazon itself has been broadcasting NFL games since 2017, and secured a $1 billion/season deal to create the league's first digital package in 2021.   \u00a0 WATCH THIS \ud83d\udcfaCall Her Daddy is taking fans back to Love Island (whether Rob likes it or not)The interview: Consider this our official petition to send Alex Cooper to Love Island\u2014not as a contestant, but as an emotional sherpa.   The Call Her Daddy\u00a0host demonstrated her therapeutic chops in a recent interview with Love Island star Rob Rausch, who showed up wearing cowboy boots, overalls, and no shirt\u2014probably because he thought the conversation \"was going to be more fun.\" (His words, not ours).    Instead, Cooper guided Rausch through a cathartic session that dug deep into his childhood, emotional boundaries, and mental health. By the end of the episode, the Love Island star had reached an epiphany all dating-weary singles eventually wrestle with:   \u275d \u00a0\"I think I need therapy.\" \u00a0 Rob Rausch  Is it any wonder Call Her Daddy is the most-listened to podcast by women?   \u00a0  Was this email forwarded to you?

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

Digital nudges can be used for altruistic purposes including protection against manipulation, but behavioural interventions have mixed effects at best. The use of these nudges by specialized units during the COVID-19 pandemic generated a societal atmosphere of fear that precipitated a deterioration of the mental and physical health of the population. The dark nudge is an incredibly effective fear-based tool that governments, political candidates, companies, NGOs, the security state, and others use to control thought and action at the individual and population level. The number of peer-reviewed papers documenting and encouraging the use of dark nudges is astounding.\u00a0 https://brownstone.org/articles/the-dark-arts-of-psychology-nudges/",

I took the bus for three years when I lived in Honolulu and haven\u2019t lived anywhere with even usable public transit since, but in those three years I had dozens of utterly bizarre experiences that were also Perfectly Normal.  This is because the human condition is vast and also Very fucking Weird. Kid one the bus next to me whose backpack starts moving and it turns out he\u2019s got three chickens and a painted turtle he caught in there? This is Perfectly Normal.  Humans have been catching small game and transporting it home in whatever they had since we invented bags to put chickens and turtles in.  I traded him three king-size snickers bars I had on me for the turtle because I vaguely remembered that many freshwater turtles were toxic to eat (incorrectly, as it turns out, but this was when I still had a Nokia Brick that lived a blissful, internet-free existence), and didn\u2019t want him accidentally poisoning his family, but didn\u2019t want to just. Steal his hard-won turtle.  This is Perfectly Normal.  Humans have been cautious about poisons, looking out for strangers kids and bartering shit since before we were technically humans, probably. Having acquired a turtle, I now needed to transport the turtle to the on-campus pond that effectively served as an Invasive Freshwater Turtle Containment Zone, but did not have a bag that could adequately contain him so I had to sit the rest of that bus ride, at the station and all through the next bus ride holding the turtle like the world\u2019s angriest hamburger. Multiple people were curious about and delighted with the turtle.  This is Perfectly Normal.  Humans love an animal, especially one that is capable of appearing grumpy, and hands are for holding things. By the time I got back to Campus, the anthropology and child psychology building that the Invasive Turtle Containment Pond was in had closed, so I had to figure out how to climb the tree over the wall and get down off the roof while holding The World\u2019s Angriest And Sharpest Hamburger. I eventually ended up having to briefly shove the turtle into by bra to get up to the initial branch and off the roof without breaking an ankle.  This is Perfectly Normal.  Humans are, as a species, a bunch of barely-evolved arboreal frugivores and really good at Tree Physics, and I don\u2019t know a single titty-having bitch out there that hasn\u2019t used their bra as Emergency Pockets at least once, if not daily. I released the turtle into the Turtle Containment Pond and then had to solve the problem of getting back OUT of the locked building, but Nokia Brick never loses a signal or drops a call (including that time I accidentally dropped it off a 13-story building in the middle of a call to my parents and the damn thing BOUNCED but kept the line open.  I miss that phone every day.) and while campus security has been carefully trained to not let people IN to places without proper ID and a call to someone inside, they assume that if you got locked in somewhere, that you got in by legitimate means and not Lemur Shenanigans, so i just called them, apologized that I\u2019d been working late with headphones on and didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been locked in.  This is Perfectly Normal, people have been lying to cops since laws were invented, and will continue to do so because all cops are bastards. Anyway, everyone should have access to good public transportation because freedom of movement is a human right and meeting a broad spectrum of humanity is good for your mental health and spiritual welfare.",

From the time of Freud therapists had rationalized their obsessive focus on libido and desire by declaring that the goal of treatment, the meaning of life, and the incontestable sign of mental health was the ability to love. Of course, they meant erotic and romantic love; they did not mean Christian agape.  Therapists often declared their patient cured when said individuals fell in love. There was a fairy tale quality to the story, not entirely inappropriate if the technique wanted to turn life into a comedy. Yet, Freud\u2019s vision was relentlessly tragic. He was not about happy endings.\u00a0  Horace decided to broach the central issue: \u201cYou believe in love; you are looking for a man who will love you despite your past. And you expect that this true love will cleanse your sins.\u201d Didn\u2019t true love mean accepting one\u2019s beloved, warts and all?  Verena was listening quietly and made no move to respond. So Horace continued. \u201cI suspect that you have had feelings of love, somehow, sometime, somewhere. Convincing yourself that you are incapable of love diminishes you as a human being. You seem to see yourself as a sexual acrobat, a fetishist who can only deploy libido when no affection or fellow-feeling is involved. In most circumstances that describes male more than female behavior.\u201d  Verena ignored it all. She kept to her beliefs: \u201cI have never fallen in love and I believe that the reason is, I did not have a father. I want to understand how this abnormal circumstance affected me.\u201d  Horace changed tactics. \u201cDoubtless there is truth in your observation, but focusing on your absent father is a counsel of despair. It still seems unlikely to me that you have never felt love for anyone. And I think it highly unlikely that no one has ever loved you. This does not mean that you noticed or cared, but I suspect that love has not been as absent as you think.  \u201cI suspect that the issue involves reciprocity. You might have felt love for some people; some people might have felt love for you. Yet, the feelings did not harmonize. You did not love someone who loved you, and vice versa. For all I know, you feared falling in love with someone who also loved you.\u201d  To which Verena replied: \u201cWhy would anyone be afraid of falling in love?\u201d  Horace ended the session by suggesting that if she were in love she might no longer recognize herself. And she might feel a yearning for domesticity, thus betraying her mother. Worse yet, it would make her feel more like a woman.\u00a0  To that remark Verena took some serious offense. When she engaged in sexual activity she felt perfectly like a woman. She had no doubts about her sexual identity. She was starting to believe that Horace was missing the point. Not that she was surprised.  For his part Horace persevered. He suggested that they draw a difference between what she felt when she was alone with a man, indulging all manner of sexual release, and when she was out in public with a man who would be identified as her beau or even husband.  A wave of anxiety threatened to drown Verena. She turned a different color and asked for a glass of water. For his part Horace was thinking that he had discovered something important.  Once she regained her composure Verena declared that she had a vision of being attached to a man, within a defined relationship, and introducing him to her mother. Worse yet, having dinner with said mother.  It was not merely that the situation was unfamiliar and thus threatening. She knew that she would not only be hurting her mother, but she would be putting said man in a position where her mother might very well treat him with contempt.  Obviously, Verena had never been on a dinner date. She had never accepted an invitation to the theatre. She had never needed to organize her life as a function of someone else, and she was certain that she would fail at the task.\u00a0  Even if she succeeded, she would feel strange being associated with a man within a relationship. It\u2019s one thing to pick up a man in a bar, take him home, have carnal relations with him, and discard him like so much used trash. It is quite another to organize your life as a function of another human being, to assume the new role, whether of girlfriend, or heaven forfend, even of wife.\u00a0  And then there was the problem of including or not including him in different activities. Besides, if she presented him as her beau, she would be defining herself in a decidedly feminine position.  If she did so and the relationship failed, she would be facing the unenviable task of explaining to friends and family what went wrong. For a woman who had succeeded at everything she had undertaken, the idea of failing at love was almost too much to bear.  Worse yet, Verena had never been on a proper date. She had never made an appointment to spend an evening with a man, to meet him somewhere, to enjoy dinner and/or a play and then to go home. She did not merely have no relationship skills. She had no dating skills either.  After all, if the purpose of any meeting is a hookup, you do not need any dating skills. You do not even need to know the other person\u2019s name. Nor do you need to divulge your own.  It was as though Verena had missed out on adolescence. And yet, if she started dating now, she would probably be so awkward that she would seem to be fake.  If she were not pretending to be fake, she would still need to repress her effulgent personality. She could not overpower a date with her wonderfulness and expect to be asked on another date.  In addition, no one really went on dates any more. As Verena continued to think about the task at hand, she was becoming increasingly anxious.  As for her feeling awkward about playing a more feminine role, the truth is, Horace shared, that men do not mind-- awkward. They are effectively suspicious when a woman is too experienced. If such is the case, they start thinking: \u201cWhere did she learn that?\u201d and cross her off the marriageable list.  And yet, for someone who has developed the habits of taking charge, the challenge not to take charge would be a challenge. It would require some serious repression, and Verena was not very confident she could do it.  Worse yet, Horace suggested that she could transition into dating by forswearing sex for a time. This was hardly an original idea. A British writer, by name of Hephzibah Anderson had done as much and had chronicled her experience in a book called: Chastened.\u00a0  Surely, this did not preclude flirting, but it would impose strict boundaries on sexual activity. Horace was explaining that removing quick hookups from the equation would cause Verena to modify her behavior. It would also signal to her male admirers that she was looking for a permanent relationship, not just a one-night-stand.\u00a0  Verena thought that this advice was very bad indeed. She was unwilling to picture herself waiting at home for a man to call and to ask her out. Wasn\u2019t she perfectly capable of taking an initiative?  And that was before she would need to learn different behaviors. How should she behave in restaurants when her date wanted to pay the bill? What about those theatre tickets, the ones he might lavish on her?  If she allows a man to take an initiative and to take control of a dating situation he would certainly feel that she owed him something in return.\u00a0  Verena listened politely to Horace\u2019s idea. She was certainly not happy to hear it. She could not imagine herself functioning the way he was describing. She could not imagine herself introducing a boyfriend, no less a husband, to her mother. She thought that Horace was a relic from a distant past, one that young people like Verena had outgrown some time ago.  She was thinking that if she had to choose between living a loveless life and dealing with people like Horace, the former was suddenly seeming to be more appealing. She started thinking that consulting with an older male coach was a decidedly bad idea.  She did not come this far in life to become a tool of the patriarchy. So, she expressed herself openly to Horace, who was prepared.  \u201cConsider this,\u201d he suggested, \u201cin the old days women refused to engage in carnal relations until they had exchanged marriage vows. An appalling practice, but sufficiently commonplace. It meant that women required that a man make a public commitment to them before they had conjugal relations. Were these women-- tools of the patriarchy?\u201d  \u201cOf course, they were,\u201d Verena interjected. She explained her heartfelt belief that the marriage ceremony was akin to being sold into chattel slavery. In the old days a married woman would become a wife, and that meant that she was her husband\u2019s property. He could do whatever he wanted to her. She had no right to object or refuse. She might even be induced to give up her name, and to take her husband\u2019s name.  Horace had heard this before. Despite the feminist attack on marriage, women still wanted to be married. If they had obligations to their husbands, their husbands also had obligations to them.  So Horace, being slightly too glib for anyone\u2019s own good, replied: Yes, modern women keep their fathers\u2019 names, and they consider it a blow against patriarchy. Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d  Dare we say, none of this made Verena very happy. Horace was challenging her most deeply held beliefs, to the point where she felt that the best course would be to fire him.  Before she had the chance to tell him what she really thought, he proposed something new. He was not going to spend time with her discussing theoretical abstractions. It would lead them nowhere.  Instead, he offered an experiment. What if Verena tried changing the way she was conducting her dating life? What if she refrained from asking any man out on a date and also refrained from hooking up with a man she had just met? What if she started developing the habit of accepting invitations to go out on dates.\u00a0  Admittedly, the only way to learn how to be pursued is to be pursued. And what if she simply refrained from sexual relations, until she had established a true connection with a man. Would she need to be committed, or would she retreat to the local feminist coven, to hear about why men were dastardly oppressive creatures.  Anyway, Verena said that she would think it over. In time she decided that she would try out Horace\u2019s experiment. She did not think it was a very good idea, but it was something new. And, if it did not work, she could blame him,  The work is now in progress. I will report further when there is more to report.  Please subscribe to my Substack, for free or preferably for a fee.

        "summary": "Good morning, C&C, it\u2019s Friday! As corporate media desperately tries to retcon Kamala \u201cPlan B\u201d Harris\u2019s reputation, your daily roundup of essential news includes: FBI questions everything, like whether President Trump was hit by a bullet at all, or whether we even need an FBI in the first place; Navy SEALs defeat the US military over jab punishments; top covid doc wins a licensing battle; entertaining video evidence that corporate media erection of newly selected democrat presidential candidate may not be gripping in the hinterlands; and guess what? It\u2019s that wonderful season of joy again that comes around every four years\u2014time to hide the homeless.  WORLD NEWS AND COMMENTARY  The New York Times ran a story yesterday headlined, \u201cF.B.I. Examining Bullet Fragments Found at Trump Rally Site.\u201d The bullet fragments are critical evidence. In short, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, a critical partner with DOJ in the vital January 6th roundup, isn\u2019t precisely certain what exactly happened to President Trump\u2019s ear on July 13th. In other words, the F.B.I. is baffled. \u201cInvestigators,\u201d the Times soberly informed readers, \u201chave not made a determination on the precise manner in which former President Donald J. Trump was injured.\u201d It could be anything. If only they had a clue! Of some kind! During Congressional testimony on Wednesday, confounded FBI Director Christopher \u201cMagoo\u201d Wray told a shocked Representative Jim Jordan (R-Oh.) that, \u201cWith respect to former President Trump, there\u2019s some question about whether or not it\u2019s a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear.\u201d Who knows what it could have been! Maybe a bullet. Or maybe it was some kind of flying shrapnel. We must also consider the possibility it was a spontaneous psychosomatic injury. Or, maybe a supersonic hummingbird? An oversized mosquito, striking at just the right moment? Mutant head lice? Quarks? A mutton? Never fear! Diligent law enforcement agents will someday solve this perplexing mystery. The FBI has their best men/women/non-binary/puppy-identifying agents on the job right now. They are working around the clock, at least 90 minutes a day, in fifteen-minute shifts between union-required two-hour mental health breaks. But there was some good news. We are much closer now to determining what might have been the mechanism of injury. After subjecting the crime scene to microscopic analysis, expert forensics, drone mapping, and satellite imagery, they have not been able to rule out the bullet theory. More importantly, according to the Times, they finally found a clue! Eight bullet casings: The trouble is, the bullet casings were not located anywhere near President Trump\u2019s ear. So a crack team of FBI forensics experts, many having face tattoos, are attempting to re-construct a scenario where the bullet casings could have engaged Trump\u2019s auditory organ and then returned to the warehouse roof. Current hypotheses include quantum mechanics and time-travel. President Trump appears vexed at the FBI\u2019s slow progress in this key area of investigation, perhaps not fully comprehending that these things take time. In a frustrated post yesterday, the victim-President suggested, just as a possibility, that the doctors who treated his head wound might be able to shed some light on the bewildering mystery: But President Trump is not a forensics expert. He doesn\u2019t even have a face tattoo. And although ten minutes ago, during the pandemic, medical experts\u2019 opinions were considered to be, well, bulletproof. But now, what do they know about gunshot wounds? Stupid doctors. Shut up and get back to the band-aids. Other difficult questions remain. Mysterious questions Director Magoo is currently considering include: was Thomas Crooks just duck hunting, and the President got in the way? Were there any bullets at all? Was there even a rally? Is there such a thing as the FBI, or are we all experiencing a nightmarish mass hallucination and could wake up sweating at any moment? You can trust the FBI to find out. They are forming theories that do not involve conspiracies, which in technical jargon are referred to as \u201cnon-conspiracy theories.\u201d We won\u2019t have to wait for long. AS a nervous nation waits impatiently for answers, the agency tentatively intends to release a report with its conclusions on or about September, 2041. Stand by.  The UK Daily Mail ran a very encouraging story yesterday headlined, \u201cNavy SEALs who refused COVID vax score major win against Biden admin.\u201d The government finally gave in and settled. Biden\u2019s August, 2021, military jab mandate caused the forced firing of over 8,000 service members who refused the shots on religious grounds, including thousands of Navy SEALs and other soldiers. On top of professionally punishing soldiers who resisted the mandate, the military had also demanded that fired soldiers pay back their signing bonuses and reimburse the government for hundreds of thousands of dollars in training. Twenty-six SEALs sued. Later, the case expanded to include all Navy service members who raised religious objections to the shots. Yesterday, after a long and difficult case, during which the government stubbornly insisted it was right all along, civil-rights law firm First Liberty announced the government had finally settled the lawsuit. Under the court-approved settlement, all soldiers, current and discharged, will have their records corrected to show they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. The Navy may not consider their refusal to take the jabs in future promotion reviews. The Navy also agreed to post a public statement affirming the Navy\u2019s new-found respect for religious service members. It must better train commanders who review religious accommodation requests, revise its accommodation request policy (which suddenly changed during the mandate), and cough up $1.5 million in attorneys\u2019 fees. Earlier in the lawsuit, the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court both upheld an injunction against the Navy restricting it from firing any more religious soldiers for jab refusal. The Mail also reported that a group of over 200 soldiers isn\u2019t satisfied with the settlement, since nobody has apologized, no officers have been disciplined for trampling on soldiers\u2019 Constitutional rights, and top brass still suffer from an intolerable infection of viral smugness. So the 200 soldiers vow to continue the war. The story also reported that, since the mandate, the Army faces a huge recruiting shortfall, which comes at a very inconvenient time considering pugilistic President Cabbage is picking fights with all comers, even though he can barely complete a sentence, much less march in a straight line. In fiscal year 2022, for example, the Army fell 10,000 short of its annual recruiting target, despite offering male recruits free boob jobs and a lovely \u201cwelcome to the Army\u201d bag of cosmetics. On a more serious note, I find it deeply fascinating, if not outright providential, that the most effective tool against jab mandates has turned out to be religious belief. Progress.  In more great news, yesterday terrific covid doc Mary Talley Bowden announced that she\u2019s won one of her medical license cases. One down, two to go. It only took ten months, but it is finally over. The Texas Medical Board has dismissed the pharmacy snitch\u2019s licensure complaint over Dr. Bowden\u2019s ivermectin prescription, which might have saved somebody\u2019s life, but who\u2019s counting: Although the Board\u2019s letter said \u201cno further action will be taken,\u201d I could suggest a few additional actions, like firing the Walgreen\u2019s pharmacist who made the complaint, boycotting the big pharmacies, and requiring Walgreen\u2019s CEO to write \u201cI\u2019m a revolting snitch\u201d a hundred times on the chalk board. But I suppose we\u2019ll have to be happy with what we can get. One thing we can do is support Dr. Bowden in her continuing battles to keep her medical license.  Corporate media\u2019s push to sanctify the democrat party\u2019s newly selected glorious leader Vice President Cackle may be too late. In this morning\u2019s first exhibit, watch carefully the other attendees on this zoom meeting react when one young lady said she\u2019ll vote for Kamala \u201cbecause she\u2019s black.\u201d CLIP: black folks are starting to get it (3:01).  Behold Exhibit Two. Listen to MSNBC viewers getting an astonishing dose of truth about how the democrat base \u201cis entirely lacking in enthusiasm\u201d and hearing \u201chorror stories\u201d about local democrat offices that can\u2019t find anybody to volunteer: CLIP: MSNBC reports on historic enthusiasm gap (0:49). You don\u2019t suppose \u2026 they could wind up dumping Kamala \u201cPlan B\u201d Harris, do you? And going with Plan C? Could they just be fronting V.P. Cackle for a little while, to draw the sting of \u201cskipping over\u201d the \u201cfirst black* woman candidate\u201d in history? (* Asian Indian.) Is there another switcheroo coming? I\u2019m only asking.  It wasn\u2019t all bad news for democrats, especially ones living in blue states. It\u2019s that wonderful season again, like Christmas but even better, when the nation gathers together in joy and harmony to cover up the most obvious side-effects of democrat policies \u2014 right before the presidential election. Yesterday, the Associated Press ran a story headlined, \u201cNewsom orders California state agencies to start clearing homeless encampments.\u201d In what the AP called Governor Newsom\u2019s \u201cboldest action yet,\u201d the leader of the Golden State issued an executive order addressed to state and local agencies, directing them \u201cto move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.\u201d Move urgently. Time is of the essence. How bold! How leaderlike! How \u2026 presidential! Under Newsom\u2019s bold, leaderlike direction, state agencies must prioritize clearing camps posing \u2018safety risks.\u2019 Officials must give homeless freeloaders \u201creasonable\u201d advance notice before bulldozing their excrement-filled trash heaps, offer them free services, and store their valuable personal belongings for at least two months. I sense a whole new season of \u201cDirty Jobs\u201d in the offing. Somebody call Mike Rowe. Local cities and counties, while not required to follow the order, were \u201curged\u201d to do the same. \u201cThere are simply no more excuses. It\u2019s time for everyone to do their part,\u201d Newsom declared boldly, in a bold, leaderlike statement yesterday. Newsom\u2019s boldest move yet was not embraced by everyone on the left. \u201cYou get your highway off-ramp clean for a moment only,\u201d Democrat Assemblywoman Alex Lee said on social media. \u201cWithout meaningful services and housing, all sweeps do is making (sic) a prominent inequality less visible.\u201d Well, yes. Making the problem less visible is precisely the point. Not only that, but earlier this year Newsom pushed a ballot measure through, allowing the state to borrow $6.4 billion dollars to build 4,350 free McMansions for vagrants and bums ($1.5 million each). A curious Associated Press noted, but promptly dismissed, what it called the \u201ccurious\u201d timing of Newsom\u2019s bold, leaderlike order \u201cgiven recent developments in the 2024 presidential race:\u201d Purely coincidental, my good man! Don\u2019t be a conspiracy theorist. The broader context, if not excuse, as repeatedly noted throughout the article, was the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision allowing cities to remove vagrants when they camp out in public places. The nation\u2019s top court overruled long-standing 9th Circuit law holding that removing pest-attracting trash lairs from downtown streets was \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d I have a different take. If we really wanted to solve this problem, we would find out who is giving the vagrants all those tents, and criminalize that, for aiding and abetting the controlled demolition of our big cities. Without tents, there\u2019d be no homeless camps. Who is giving drug addicts free tents on demand? To be clear, I agree we face a horrific social tragedy of widespread drug addiction and mental illnesses (which are probably caused by some pharmaceutical or other, but I digress). We should help those folks, who are after all our sons and daughters and fellow Americans.* But most of all, we should help them by rooting out the people and organizations enabling \u2014 if not inviting \u2014 people to live that way. (* don\u2019t get me started on the border crisis. If only we had a border czar.) In any case, people who live in blue states are about to enjoy a brief stay of civilizational execution, as those areas clean themselves up \u2014and clean up their favorite oleaginous governor\u2014 in a grotesque display of pure performative politics.

        "title": "'Dear Black Girls': How A'ja Wilson Is Helping Black Girls Heal & Bloom With Confidence",
        "url": "https://www.xonecole.com/dear-black-girls-takeaways/",
        "summary": "In recent years, books written by Black women, such as Viola Davis, Michelle Obama, and Taraji P. Henson, have adorned our shelves and shown the great trials and tribulations one has had to endure to become the woman we see today. Though their narratives show great accomplishments, they explain in detail the price that had to be paid to achieve their monumental success. Often, this price came at the cost of having to endure unspeakable tragedy. The world was being carried on their shoulders and backs, and they had to learn to balance the weight of it all. Despite the odds, they managed to grow and become exceptionally talented women with limited support or, most of the time, alone. However, in A'ja Wilson's recently published book, Dear Black Girls, this narrative is changing for the better. The memoir shows that WNBA superstar, and growing legend, A'ja Wilson isn't just a force to reckon with on the court, racking up championships, MVP awards, Olympic gold, and season-record-breaking accomplishments. Her impact transcends the game, reaching into the hearts of young Black women and girls, who like me might have once felt a pang of otherness for embracing their inner tomboy.  Wilson's recently published book offered a powerful remedy, a story that mirrored my own experiences and gently soothed the wounds of not always fitting in. This collection of honest stories is not just about Wilson's journey, it's also a book that holds the potential to heal and inspire countless other Black girls who deserve to see themselves reflected in the pages of a champion.  \n\nMacmillan Publishers\n Although Wilson discusses the tribulations she had to overcome, she didn't have to do them alone and often had more than one support system installed to ensure her success. This book ultimately shows the beauty that grows when Black girls are raised with nourishment, intentionality, and understanding rather than the unrelenting grief and sadness that many believe are necessary to raise Black girls.  In Dear Black Girls: How to Be True to You, the two-time MVP shows us that love, rather than unending tragedy, can be the source of success for all Black girls--past, present, and future. Wilson also shows us how love can occasionally come from an unexpected source--a stranger who only has compassion, empathy, and understanding to offer. Living While Black There comes a point in time, in every Black girl's life, where they learn that they are not just a girl, but a Black girl. For me, it was on the playground of my elementary school, where a white girl--who I thought was my friend--called me the n-word when I refused to join her in a fight against a mutual friend. For A'ja Wilson, it was when her \"friend\" refused to invite her to her house for a sleepover, unless she slept outside. When asked why she had to be the only one to sleep outside, she was quickly informed it had been due to her race. Though her parents discussed it with her and explained why she and the young lady could no longer be friends, A'ja Wilson offers a relatable lens to express the grief of realizing one's otherness. The year she discovered her Blackness meant a difference, Wilson felt alone and began isolating herself. It wasn't until she met a woman who worked in the cafeteria that she understood the importance of being seen by someone who looked like her. In Dear Black Girls, Wilson teaches the importance of representation and finding someone who \"looks like you\" and actively cares and checks in with you. Though the young readers of this book will most likely never meet Wilson, she provides her novel as a stand-in role model who actively sees how alone some Black girls feel in the world and tells them lovely: \"I see you, I got you.\" Finding Oneself There is a certain power in discovering one's \"why.\" In Dear Black Girls, Wilson explains that in order to find oneself or one's reasons for doing things, it might be important to look to your elders. The ones that could make you believe in yourself. For Wilson, it was her grandmother. Her grandmother was her place of solace and the person she felt closest to. Before she picked up the game of basketball, A'ja's grandmother believed she was special and would achieve so many things in life.  Through this belief, she nurtured Wilson and taught her to believe in the good that everyone had to possess. She taught Wilson that Black women could be heroes, and knew how to \"walk the walk\" and \"talk the talk.\" She taught Wilson, and in turn, Wilson has taught Black girls, that finding oneself can be done at the hands of the ones that we love. And that if one's love is strong enough, we can \"freeze it, and preserve that safe space forever.\"  It's Okay to Be Different In school, Wilson was considered a \"slow learner.\" Diagnosed with dyslexia at the late age of 16, she believed she had not been as \"smart\" as the other kids. Wilson would freeze up in class, and despite loving to write narratives and the school itself, she found she did not catch on with her peers as quickly as she liked. She spent hours on end stressing about being different, so much so, that at times the thought of her otherness became debilitating and all-consuming. With her family and in her solitude, she understood who she was. However, among her friends and in class, she found that she didn't know who she was, nor who they wanted her to be.  From this, she taught Black girls that being a teen is stressful enough, so being oneself should be easily embraced. Though, she admits to not knowing the right thing to say, do, or act, and therefore is unable to give us \"cheat codes,\" the best thing a young Black girl can do, is just be.  Find Your Gardener I often say that Black women have learned to grow without nourishment. So, in reading Dear Black Girl, it was a refreshing change of pace to read that Wilson had been adorned with love, guidance, honesty, and protection by strong support systems in her life. One of those support systems was Wilson's father. Her father taught her many things in life, but one that was most essential was the importance of perseverance and overcoming mediocrity. See, despite being the best in her career, Wilson and basketball did not mesh well from the start. Instead, she had been known to try many things and was lackluster at best.  Nevertheless, when Wilson was told that she did not play well by her father--after asking why she wasn't getting any playing time--she finally learned to overcome her challenges.  Not because she suddenly practiced more, or believed she could do anything with time. She became better because her father gave her the option to walk away from the sport. He allowed her to be scared, to be unsure of what she wanted in life, and freed her of the stress of absolutes. Through encouragement, he became her gardener--always trying to bring out the best in her through \"easy\" and \"tough\" love. In Dear Black Girls, Wilson encourages Black girls to find their \"gardeners,\" the people in their lives who bring out the best in them, drive them crazy and are never afraid to tell them how it is. The person that pulls out all of the weeds and negativity, and leaves enough space for you to receive sunlight and bloom.  Gaining a Nonsense Detector While finding a gardener, Wilson also encourages Black girls to find or gain a \"nonsense detector.\" A nonsense detector is just as it sounds, someone who can detect the nonsense that the world is attempting to bring to them and help them identify what it truly is. They are the person who is willing to approach a spade and call it by its name. In Wilson's life, this was her mother. A'ja's mom encouraged her to think logically about her education and its relationship to her basketball career.  She was the person Wilson called when she learned to drive in a new state or deal with the stress of her newfound career. Through her mother's encouragement, she learned not to chase after boys or some concept of a new sense of self, instead, she learned to make decisions with her best interest in mind. In doing so, she chose family, which meant more time with her grandmother, which she would not have had if she hadn't learned to listen to something that encourages no-nonsense.",

        "url": "https://dailynewsfromaolf.substack.com/p/newsom-issues-eo-for-california-cities",
        "summary": "By Tyler Durden The order directs state agencies to remove thousands of tents and makeshift shelters along freeways, shopping center parking lots, and city parks - and puts the decision in the hands of local authorities. Newsom's EO comes after a decision by the Supreme Court earlier this summer which allows cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces, AP reports. The case was the most significant on the issue to come before the high court in decades and comes as cities across the country have wrestled with the politically complicated issue of how to deal with a rising number of people without a permanent place to live and public frustration over related health and safety issues. \"We must act with urgency to address dangerous encampments,\" Newsom said in a statement. The Daily News from the Art of Liberty Foundation is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. The Supreme Court's decision is related to a lower court's ruling on a case known as Grants Pass, which blocked cities from clearing encampments. Earlier this week we noted that San Francisco has already taken steps to craft policies which allow officials to begin sweeping encampments, according to Mayor London Breed. As the Epoch Times reports, officials are contemplating options with the city attorney\u2019s office and more information will be shared soon, according to Ms. Breed. \u201cThis decision by the Supreme Court will help cities like San Francisco manage our public spaces more effectively and efficiently,\u201d Ms. Breed said in a June 28 press release. \u201cThis decision recognizes that cities must have more flexibility to address challenges on our streets.\u201d She said discussions underway aim to reduce homelessness while finding people mental health treatment and services to improve the quality of life for all San Franciscans. \u201c[Illegal camping] is not healthy, safe, or compassionate for people on the street, and it\u2019s not acceptable for our neighborhoods,\u201d Ms. Breed said. One San Francisco local said he supports increased enforcement because of what he described as \u201cfilthy\u201d conditions in some areas. \u201cThe city has become known for feces on the sidewalks and dirty streets,\u201d John Walker told The Epoch Times July 22. \u201cSomething needs to be done.\u201d After the high court\u2019s ruling was announced in June, the state\u2019s Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals quickly moved to discontinue the injunction blocking homeless camp sweeps.

        "summary": "giritina: A small thought for disability pride month\u2026 There\u2019s a stereotype/myth/common perception that mental health meds make people\u2019s art worse. Sometimes, it\u2019s portrayed as people being incapable of making art at all. Other times, they simply don\u2019t have anything interesting to say now that they\u2019re \u201chappy.\u201d Some people even avoid going on meds because they worry about not being able to make art.  I want to share some pages of a comic I made during a manic episode, before I was on any proper medication.  I think this comic is very interesting, very raw and unique, but this was my attempt to be understood by other people. I made this art thinking that other people would know exactly what I meant by it. I thought this was incredibly clear, that it would communicate everything I was going through and had experienced without any ambiguity. When people didn\u2019t react how I wanted, when they couldn\u2019t parse it in the way I intended, it hurt me. Here was my best attempt to be understood, and I remained alone. Now I\u2019ll show some comics I made after being on a mood stabilizer/antipsychotic. You can say what you like about the artistic merit of it compared to that raw, abstract work I made before, but what matters to me is that I was actually able to connect to other people through this art. When I showed this work to people, their reaction was in line with what I intended. They saw part of me. I made it to show a side of myself I was incapable of expressing without art, and when people read it, they actually saw that side of me.  Without medication, I was trapped in my own world. I couldn\u2019t even begin to fathom how to connect to another person because we weren\u2019t using the same vocabulary. You might be \u201cinterested\u201d or \u201ccompelled\u201d by my suffering, but part of that interest comes from the mystery of my delirium. No matter how unique the result, it still represented a failure of intent. Learning to make art again after exiting that delirium was difficult, but I promise you it was and is worth it.",

        "url": "https://egrojworld.blogspot.com/2022/11/dave-sear-i-always-thought-my-thoughts.html",
        "summary": "\u00a0    Born in Luton Dave Sear is a Birmingham based trombonist and composer who graduated from the Jazz Course at the city\u2019s Royal Birmingham Conservatoire in 2016, where his tutors included many well known musicians from both sides of the Atlantic, among them Percy Pursglove who plays trumpet on this recording. Sear also studied at the Englesholm Winter Jazz Camp in Denmark.  Sear is now a professional musician who has appeared at many prestigious venues and festivals and who now also reaches jazz trombone at his \u2018alma mater\u2019 the RBC. In addition to leading his quintet he is also a member of the Heavy Beat Brass Band and of the party band Diddy Sweg. He has recorded regularly with the Birmingham Jazz Orchestra as well as appearing as a sideman on numerous albums by other Midlands based jazz artists.  \u201cI Always Thought My Thoughts Were Me\u201d represents Sear\u2019s d\u00e9but album as a leader and features an all star Birmingham based band that includes Pursglove, pianist Elliott Sansom, bassist James Owston and drummer Jim Bashford, all of them bandleaders in their own right.  The album repertoire includes five original compositions by Sear plus the trombonist\u2019s own arrangements of \u201cIn Your Own Sweet Way\u201d by pianist Dave Brubeck and \u201cInner Urge\u201d by saxophonist Joe Henderson. Given the relative youthfulness of the line up the group sound is rather more mainstream than I was expecting but the album is none the worse for that. Sear demonstrates an admirable fluency and agility as a trombone soloist and he also impresses in his role as a composer, arranger and bandleader. He receives excellent support from some of the most accomplished players on the Birmingham jazz scene, all musicians with a national reputation.  The album takes its title from Sear\u2019s struggles with his mental health, as he explains in his remarkably candid liner notes; \u201cI\u2019ve always struggled to get my head around my own mental health and I have lived for as long as I can remember with OCD and anxiety. The music on this album is about living with these issues on a day to day basis, which is something that I know I share with a huge number of people. Music, especially Jazz music in the later stages of my life, has been an everlasting friend and continual support, which I am thoroughly grateful for. I\u2019m not great with words and seem to speak the most sense through the trombone, so this album is my acknowledgement of appreciation and respect to the music, to all my family and friends, and to everyone who\u2019s taking the time to listen to me\u201d.  In the press release accompanying this recording he offers further insights into the making of the album; \u201cDuring the Covid lockdown period I had a lot more time to think, and overthink, and it really dawned on me that so many people struggle with the same issues as me, even though I used to think my thoughts were \u2018normal\u2019. Jazz music has been a great friend and a continual support throughout the last decade of my life and I wanted to recognise that in the music. I reflect on the harder aspect of living with these issues, as well as the positive, embracing good times and thanking many of the people and places that have been of significant help throughout.\u201d  Of his colleagues he remarks; \u201cI had this quintet in mind when writing the music. I feel extremely grateful and fortunate to have had the opportunity to play and record with them all\u201d.  The album commences with the attention grabbing \u201cReservoir Retreat\u201d, a high energy group performance that skilfully blends conventional jazz and bebop virtues with more contemporary ideas. It quickly establishes Sear as a musician with a highly impressive technique on his chosen instrument, and as a powerful and fluent soloist. These qualities are also true of Sansom and Pursglove, both of whom feature strongly with barnstorming solos of their own. Bassist Owston, perhaps best known for his work with saxophonist Xhosa Cole, is a forceful and propulsive presence throughout, linking up superbly with the hard driving but neatly detailed drumming of Jim Bashford. Sear\u2019s solo includes a passage featuring just trombone and bass while Bashford enjoys a series of dynamic drum fills.  The title track is slightly less frenetic but still swings convincingly, again skilfully blending the old and the new. The opening passage features a beguiling blend of trombone and trumpet as the rhythm section impart a steady, swinging momentum. Pursglove\u2019s bravado trumpet solo finds him engaged in fiery, fluid dialogue with drummer Bashford, Pursglove\u2019s trumpet reaching for the stars, underpinned by the drummer\u2019s polyrhythmic flow. The quintet then reel things back in again with a swinging ensemble passage, from which the leader eventually emerges to deliver a trombone solo above the crisp and swinging rhythms. He\u2019s followed by the excellent Sansom before the quintet take things swinging out with another ensemble passage featuring the impressive playing of the trombone / trumpet front line, sometimes sounding like more than a mere two players.  Introduced by Owston\u2019s bass \u201cEyes That Speak A Thousand Words\u201d reflects a more contemplative side of the band, a rubato ballad featuring the meditative playing of the two horns above an atmospheric backdrop featuring mallet rumbles and cymbal shimmers. The piece becomes increasingly dramatic as it progresses, before gradually subsiding once more. Again the interplay between Sear and his former mentor Pursglove is impressive, with Sansom\u2019s playing eventually coming into focus towards the close.  Introduced by Bashford at the drums \u201cVisual Balance\u201d is another swinging, up-tempo number that acts as the springboard for virtuoso solos from Sear and Sansom. It\u2019s a high energy performance that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place on a classic Blue Note record and was even released as a single.  Dave Brubeck\u2019s \u201cIn Your Own Sweet Way\u201d slows the pace down a little but the performance still retains a sense of swing with Sear\u2019s arrangement bringing a contemporary twist to the original. Pursglove solos with great fluency and virtuosity, eventually followed by the leader on trombone and Sansom at the piano. Owston and Bashford also play significant roles as they interact with the soloists, with Bashford enjoying his own feature towards the close.  The album\u2019s second cover follows immediately with Sear\u2019s arrangement of Joe Henderson\u2019s \u201cInner Urge\u201d. Bashford again features strongly, no more so than in the introductory drums and horns dialogue, which eventually leads into a spirited group rendition of Henderson\u2019s theme. This provides the jumping off point for further bravura soloing from Pursglove, whose trumpet pyrotechnics have attracted comparisons with Dizzy Gillespie. He\u2019s more than matched by Sear on trombone. Bashford then returns to the fore in another joust with the horns prior to the collective finale.  Sear\u2019s own \u201cBlues for Rockydella Rascal\u201d is written in the style of a standard and again sounds as if it could have come from the vintage Blue Note catalogue. It\u2019s an up-tempo piece that swings relentlessly and triggers a rousing trombone solo from Sear. Owston, an impressive presence throughout, is rewarded with his first solo of the set and Bashford again shines at the drums with a series of breaks. There\u2019s plenty of energetic, but sharply focussed ensemble playing too.  The album concludes with an alternative take on \u201cEyes That Speak a Thousand Words\u201d, a performance that is essentially similar to its companion.  \u201cI Always Thought My Thought Were Me\u201d represents an impressive d\u00e9but from Sear. Despite his self acknowledged troubles with mental health the mood of the album is largely upbeat and swinging, acknowledging the joy that jazz has brought into his life. Sear impresses as a player, composer, arranger and bandleader and there is a real musical chemistry between all the members of the quintet, who all perform superbly whether as individual soloists or as a unit.  The album was documented at Sansom Studios in Birmingham, owned by Elliott Sansom and his brother Olly. It was recorded and mixed by Olly Sansom and he and mastering engineer Peter Beckmann deserve great credit for making the music and musicians sound so good.  Although there\u2019s nothing radically new here this is a highly enjoyable album that features some terrific playing from all concerned. As such it\u2019s a very good advertisement for the strength of the Birmingham jazz scene and one also suspects that this quintet would represent a highly exciting live attraction. I hope to be able to catch them at a gig at some point in the future. https://www.thejazzmann.com/reviews/review/dave-sear-i-always-thought-my-thoughts-were-me   Bio: Born in Luton, Dave started playing the trombone aged 8.

El repertorio del \u00e1lbum incluye cinco composiciones originales de Sear m\u00e1s los arreglos propios del trombonista de \"In Your Own Sweet Way\" del pianista Dave Brubeck y \"Inner Urge\" del saxofonista Joe Henderson. Dada la relativa juventud de la formaci\u00f3n, el sonido del grupo es bastante m\u00e1s convencional de lo que esperaba, pero el \u00e1lbum no es peor por ello. Sear demuestra una admirable fluidez y agilidad como solista de tromb\u00f3n y tambi\u00e9n impresiona en su papel de compositor, arreglista y director de banda. Recibe un excelente apoyo de algunos de los m\u00fasicos m\u00e1s consumados de la escena del jazz de Birmingham, todos ellos con reputaci\u00f3n nacional.  El \u00e1lbum toma su t\u00edtulo de las luchas de Sear con su salud mental, como explica en sus notas de presentaci\u00f3n, notablemente sinceras; \"Siempre he luchado por entender mi propia salud mental y he vivido desde que tengo uso de raz\u00f3n con TOC y ansiedad. La m\u00fasica de este \u00e1lbum trata de la vida cotidiana con estos problemas, que es algo que s\u00e9 que comparto con un gran n\u00famero de personas. La m\u00fasica, especialmente la m\u00fasica de jazz en las \u00faltimas etapas de mi vida, ha sido una amiga eterna y un apoyo continuo, por lo que estoy muy agradecida. No soy muy bueno con las palabras y parece que hablo con m\u00e1s sentido a trav\u00e9s del tromb\u00f3n, as\u00ed que este disco es mi reconocimiento y respeto a la m\u00fasica, a toda mi familia y amigos, y a todos los que se toman el tiempo de escucharme\".  En el comunicado de prensa que acompa\u00f1a a esta grabaci\u00f3n, ofrece m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n sobre la realizaci\u00f3n del \u00e1lbum; Durante el periodo de encierro de Covid tuve mucho m\u00e1s tiempo para pensar, y pensar demasiado, y me di cuenta de que mucha gente lucha con los mismos problemas que yo, aunque yo sol\u00eda pensar que mis pensamientos eran \"normales\". La m\u00fasica de jazz ha sido una gran amiga y un apoyo continuo a lo largo de la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada de mi vida y quer\u00eda reconocerlo en la m\u00fasica. Reflexiono sobre el aspecto m\u00e1s duro de vivir con estos problemas, as\u00ed como sobre el positivo, abrazando los buenos momentos y agradeciendo a muchas de las personas y lugares que han sido de gran ayuda en todo momento\".  De sus compa\u00f1eros comenta; \"Ten\u00eda a este quinteto en mente cuando escrib\u00eda la m\u00fasica. Me siento muy agradecido y afortunado por haber tenido la oportunidad de tocar y grabar con todos ellos\".  El \u00e1lbum comienza con la llamativa \"Reservoir Retreat\", una actuaci\u00f3n de grupo de gran energ\u00eda que combina h\u00e1bilmente las virtudes convencionales del jazz y el bebop con ideas m\u00e1s contempor\u00e1neas. R\u00e1pidamente establece a Sear como un m\u00fasico con una t\u00e9cnica impresionante en su instrumento elegido, y como un solista poderoso y fluido. Estas cualidades tambi\u00e9n son v\u00e1lidas para Sansom y Pursglove, que aparecen con fuerza con sus propios solos. El bajista Owston, tal vez m\u00e1s conocido por su trabajo con el saxofonista Xhosa Cole, es una presencia contundente y propulsora en todo momento, enlazando magn\u00edficamente con la bater\u00eda de Jim Bashford, dura pero bien detallada. El solo de Sear incluye un pasaje en el que s\u00f3lo aparecen el tromb\u00f3n y el bajo, mientras que Bashford disfruta de una serie de din\u00e1micos rellenos de bater\u00eda.  El tema que da t\u00edtulo al disco es algo menos fren\u00e9tico, pero sigue oscilando de forma convincente, combinando de nuevo con habilidad lo antiguo y lo nuevo. El pasaje de apertura presenta una seductora mezcla de tromb\u00f3n y trompeta mientras la secci\u00f3n r\u00edtmica imparte un impulso constante y oscilante. El valiente solo de trompeta de Pursglove se encuentra en un di\u00e1logo ardiente y fluido con el baterista Bashford, la trompeta de Pursglove alcanzando las estrellas, apuntalada por el flujo polir\u00edtmico del baterista. El quinteto vuelve a retomar las cosas con un pasaje de ensamble oscilante, del que el l\u00edder finalmente emerge para ofrecer un solo de tromb\u00f3n por encima de los ritmos n\u00edtidos y oscilantes. Le sigue el excelente Sansom antes de que el quinteto se ponga en marcha con otro pasaje de conjunto en el que destaca la impresionante interpretaci\u00f3n de la primera l\u00ednea de trombones y trompetas, que a veces suena como algo m\u00e1s que dos m\u00fasicos.  Introducido por el bajo de Owston, \"Eyes That Speak A Thousand Words\" refleja un lado m\u00e1s contemplativo de la banda, una balada rubato con la interpretaci\u00f3n meditativa de las dos trompetas sobre un fondo atmosf\u00e9rico con estruendos de mazas y brillos de platillos. La pieza se vuelve cada vez m\u00e1s dram\u00e1tica a medida que avanza, antes de calmarse gradualmente una vez m\u00e1s. Una vez m\u00e1s, la interacci\u00f3n entre Sear y su antiguo mentor Pursglove es impresionante, y la interpretaci\u00f3n de Sansom se centra en el final.  Introducido por Bashford a la bater\u00eda, \"Visual Balance\" es otro n\u00famero movido y con mucho ritmo que sirve de trampol\u00edn para los virtuosos solos de Sear y Sansom. Es una interpretaci\u00f3n de gran energ\u00eda que no desentonar\u00eda en un disco cl\u00e1sico de Blue Note y que incluso se public\u00f3 como single.  In Your Own Sweet Way\" de Dave Brubeck ralentiza un poco el ritmo, pero la interpretaci\u00f3n sigue conservando el sentido del swing con el arreglo de Sear que aporta un toque contempor\u00e1neo al original. Pursglove hace un solo con gran fluidez y virtuosismo, seguido finalmente por el l\u00edder al tromb\u00f3n y Sansom al piano. Owston y Bashford tambi\u00e9n juegan un papel importante al interactuar con los solistas, con Bashford disfrutando de su propia caracter\u00edstica hacia el final.  La segunda versi\u00f3n del \u00e1lbum sigue inmediatamente con el arreglo de Sear de \"Inner Urge\" de Joe Henderson. Bashford vuelve a aparecer con fuerza, sobre todo en el di\u00e1logo introductorio de la bater\u00eda y las trompas, que finalmente desemboca en una animada interpretaci\u00f3n en grupo del tema de Henderson. Esto proporciona el punto de partida para m\u00e1s solos de bravura de Pursglove, cuya pirotecnia de trompeta ha atra\u00eddo comparaciones con Dizzy Gillespie. Sear, con el tromb\u00f3n, le acompa\u00f1a con creces. Bashford vuelve a la palestra en otra disputa con las trompas antes del final colectivo.  El \"Blues for Rockydella Rascal\" de Sear est\u00e1 escrito en el estilo de un est\u00e1ndar y de nuevo suena como si pudiera haber salido del cat\u00e1logo vintage de Blue Note. Es una pieza con mucho ritmo que se balancea implacablemente y provoca un emocionante solo de tromb\u00f3n de Sear. Owston, una presencia impresionante en todo momento, es recompensado con su primer solo del conjunto y Bashford vuelve a brillar a la bater\u00eda con una serie de quiebros. Tambi\u00e9n hay mucha energ\u00eda, pero muy enfocada en el conjunto.  El \u00e1lbum concluye con una versi\u00f3n alternativa de \"Eyes That Speak a Thousand Words\", una interpretaci\u00f3n que es esencialmente similar a su compa\u00f1era.  \"I Always Thought My Thought Were Me\" representa un debut impresionante de Sear. A pesar de sus reconocidos problemas de salud mental, el estado de \u00e1nimo del \u00e1lbum es en gran medida optimista y con swing, reconociendo la alegr\u00eda que el jazz ha tra\u00eddo a su vida. Sear impresiona como int\u00e9rprete, compositor, arreglista y director de orquesta, y existe una verdadera qu\u00edmica musical entre todos los miembros del quinteto, que act\u00faan magn\u00edficamente, ya sea como solistas individuales o como unidad.  El \u00e1lbum se document\u00f3 en los estudios Sansom de Birmingham, propiedad de Elliott Sansom y su hermano Olly. Fue grabado y mezclado por Olly Sansom y \u00e9l y el ingeniero de masterizaci\u00f3n Peter Beckmann merecen un gran cr\u00e9dito por hacer que la m\u00fasica y los m\u00fasicos suenen tan bien.  Aunque no hay nada radicalmente nuevo aqu\u00ed, es un \u00e1lbum muy agradable que cuenta con una interpretaci\u00f3n excelente por parte de todos los implicados. Como tal, es un muy buen anuncio de la fuerza de la escena de jazz de Birmingham y uno tambi\u00e9n sospecha que este quinteto representar\u00eda una atracci\u00f3n muy emocionante en vivo. Espero poder verlos en un concierto en el futuro. https://www.thejazzmann.com/reviews/review/dave-sear-i-always-thought-my-thoughts-were-me   Bio: Nacido en Luton, Dave comenz\u00f3 a tocar el tromb\u00f3n a los 8 a\u00f1os.

Food allergies. GERD. Vision problems. Skin problems. For people that menstruate, conditions that cause irregular and painful cycles. Those are all disabling. Anything that impairs you from functioning or completing a basic life task without accommodation is a disability. Anything that makes you spend days in bed during a flare up is a disability! Not everyone experiences your symptoms and you\u2019re not being weak or whiny.  Mental illnesses that people treat as \u201cmainstream\u201d these days like anxiety, depression, or ADHD are still disabilities. Overcoming a massive struggle just to get out of bed, slow down your thoughts, or focus on what you need/want to do is disabling. Starting the day with less mental energy than most people is disabling.  For the migraine people: yes, everyone gets headaches, but no not everyone gets migraines. It\u2019s a condition that can be inherited in which our nerves are literally wired differently and more sensitive than someone who doesn\u2019t get migraines.  For the food allergy and digestive disorder people: if you eat something your body can\u2019t tolerate, you become sick. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a trip to the ER or skin irritation for a few hours, that\u2019s a negative response in your body. Going hungry at social events because you can\u2019t eat anything, that\u2019s not something you just have to grin and bear. Prohibitively expensive or hard-to-find accessible food. Most people have the privilege of not worrying about eating.  For people with abnormal menstrual cycles: you don\u2019t have to suck it up because \u201clots of people get periods, no one likes them, but they all deal with it.\u201d Majority of people who get periods don\u2019t spend days in bed with debilitating pain or nausea. Your heightened struggle is real. Going months between cycles can increase your risk of health conditions down the line, and it\u2019s good to speak to a gynecologist if you have access to one.  If you are feeling discomfort on a regular basis in any part of your body, or if you usually feel unwell after eating, that isn\u2019t normal and you deserve medical attention and support  Edit to reiterate this list is not exhaustive!  I had a bunch of people mock me for saying that if you need to use a CPAP machine, you are disabled and using a disability aid. In the context of people openly discussing how horrible it is to be in a relationship with someone who needs a CPAP machine to sleep. People who used those machines were arguing that they weren\u2019t disabled, despite needing the machine to sleep, and needing sleep to live and not go insane. People who didn\u2019t use the machines were arguing that it\u2019s alright to dehumanize people who use the machines, because they\u2019re annoying and gross.  There are a lot of disabilities that aren\u2019t considered disabilities.",

The existing procedures often extend the process unnecessarily, leaving employees in limbo for 6-18 months or longer. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s insight revealed that these delays and complexities discourage many employees from completing the necessary steps to return to duty, thereby jeopardizing their careers.\n A Comprehensive Continuum of Care\n At DOT SAP Counseling, the commitment to clients goes beyond the initial phases of the SAP process. After clients complete the first four steps with a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP), DOT SAP Counseling ensures they are not left to navigate the final two steps\u2014Return to Duty Testing and Follow-Up Testing\u2014on their own. This comprehensive support system addresses the gaps in the current procedures, providing clients with the resources, networking connections, and ongoing guidance necessary for a successful return to duty.\n Empowering Clients with Support and Resources\n Unlike other SAP companies, DOT SAP Counseling offers clients access to over 300 SAP-friendly employers, simplifying the often challenging job search process. This network of supportive employers, combined with the company\u2019s deep understanding of the DOT regulations, empowers clients to bring solutions to potential employers, enhancing their employability. By connecting clients with third-party administrators (CTPA) who facilitate the testing process, DOT SAP Counseling alleviates the burden on employers, making it easier for them to comply with DOT requirements and focus on their core business operations.",

        "summary": "Published on July 26, 2024 11:18 AM GMT  \u201cYou should practise acceptance.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re being too hard on yourself, you should accept yourself more.\u201d \u201cSounds reasonable. I think I get the \u201cvibe\u201d of acceptance, but I still feel confused. How do I practise acceptance?\u201d \u201cMmm I haven\u2019t thought hard about this before. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s about loving every part of you, even your weaknesses and failures. And it\u2019s about treating yourself kindly.\u201d \u201cHmm I don\u2019t know. Acceptance, love, and kindness seem close to each other in\u00a0concept space, but so are empathy, openness, forgiveness, and possibly other related virtues. Like, you could say accepting yourself is about being empathetic to yourself. Or accepting yourself is about being open to yourself and not judging yourself too harshly. Or accepting yourself is about forgiving yourself from making mistakes. All of these could plausibly become advice related to acceptance, and even each other. Obviously, the meaning changes depending on the context and I don\u2019t want to dictate how this word should be used, but I\u2019m getting the sense that acceptance as a concept is a bit \u2018stretchy\u2019?\u201d \u201cErr...\u201d \u201cAnd can you actually love every part of yourself? If I like hurting people, should I love this part of me too?\u201d \u201cUgh you\u2019re over-thinking things! Go figure it out yourself.\u201d And I did. My cursory search of \u201cacceptance\u201d turned into a much wider literature review, including literature around the use of words in relation to truth-seeking. And I\u2019ve decided to put some of my findings down in this writing with this following structure: \u201cAcceptance\u201d as seen in dictionaries\u201cAcceptance\u201d as seen in various adviceSome thoughts and analysis on how \u201cacceptance\u201d is commonly usedHere\u2019s a warning, this piece of writing can get quite tedious. If you\u2019ve felt confused about how \u201cacceptance\u201d is defined or used, this might be for you. Or if you\u2019ve been wanting to practise \u201cacceptance\u201d but don\u2019t know where to start, you can just jump straight to Section 2. 1. \u201cAcceptance\u201d as seen in dictionariesI agree with Yudkowsky (2008) that dictionaries are more of a historical record of how words are used, rather than an authoritative record on how words should be used. And I also agree with him that words can be treated as public goods\u2014the more one uses a word in a way that has a very different meaning than how people commonly use it, the harder it is for people to coordinate. For example, if a significant number of people start calling pens as \u201cpencils\u201d and pencils as \u201cpens\u201d, you\u2019ll need to constantly ask (probably with annoyance), \u201cwait, are you talking about the thing that has ink or the thing that has graphite?\u201d So, there\u2019s no need to worry about the dictionary police enforcing how you should use a word, but understanding how \u201cacceptance\u201d is commonly used and comparing them to definitions found in common advice related to \u201cacceptance\u201d might help us better understand how boundaries are drawn between acceptance, kindness, love, etc. I\u2019ve chosen six definitions out of many that I thought are most commonly used by people from the Oxford English Dictionary (n.d.) and The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (n.d.), and I\u2019ve listed them below: 1.a. Acceptance as receiving somethingDefinition: The act of taking or receiving something that is offered or given (e.g., gifts, payments, responsibility, etc).Example: \"I accept credit card payments.\u201d1.b. Acceptance as agreeingDefinition: The act of communicating yes to an offer, or promising to do a particular thing (e.g., invitations, job offers, etc).Example: \u201cI accept your offer.\u201d1.c. Acceptance as giving someone or something a positive value judgementDefinition: The act of approving something or someone, where approving means the act of giving a positive value judgement\u00a0to something; or assessing and believing something as favourable, proper, suitable, or fulfilling certain conditions or requirements.Example: \u201cI accept this quality of work.\u201d1.d. Acceptance as allowing a person to join a groupDefinition: The act of admitting someone into or allowing someone to join a group, clique, community, or organisation, either informally (e.g., through casual interactions) or formally (e.g., through an application process).Example: \u201cI accept your admission into our organisation.\u201dNotes: There\u2019s a sense of fulfilling a person\u2019s needs for belonging, inclusiveness, and like/love, support, respect, acknowledgement, and social safety.Possible confusion: note that acceptance as the act of admitting someone into a group does not automatically imply another definition of acceptance, specifically the act of giving a positive value judgement\u00a0to someone or something (e.g., I want Kit Xiang to join our group because they\u2019re a good person).1.e. Acceptance as believing something as trueDefinition: The act of believing something is true, correct, or valid, sometimes even when one initially believes differently.Example: \u201cI accept this hypothesis.\u201dNotes: Possible confusion: Note that acceptance as the act of giving a positive value judgement\u00a0(related to axiology) and acceptance as the act of believing something as true\u00a0(related to epistemology) are sometimes used as one combined definition. But there are cases where only one of the two definitions are only used, which can lead to ambiguous interpretations.1.f. Acceptance as tolerating or giving inDefinition: The act of tolerating or enduring something unpleasant or undesired with restraint or patience.The act of surrendering, submitting, yielding to something unpleasant or undesired without resisting, fighting, or changing it.Example: \"I have accepted that my chronic back pain will never be cured.\u201dNotes: Possible confusion: I\u2019ve included two definitions for this type of acceptance, because both dictionaries cited combine these two subtly different meanings into one definition. And I wanted to make this distinction more explicit, because acceptance-related advice are much more likely to use the second definition than the first.The first definition (i.e., act of tolerance) implies that there\u2019s at least a bit of resistance or some stubborn unyielding-ness from the person doing the acceptance. One example could be a person calmly and patiently biding their time before fighting back. Another example could be a person tensing when visiting a dentist.The second definition implies that there\u2019s no resistance or struggle in the acceptance. An example could be a person fully embracing the sadness of losing someone. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to always get to zero resistance, e.g., a person experiencing extreme pain.2. \u201cAcceptance\u201d as seen in various adviceFirst, let me be clear with the kind of \u201cacceptance\u201d I\u2019m looking for in advice. It needs to fulfil both of the following criteria: They are mental moves. When you do \u201cacceptance\u201d, you\u2019re taking an action or series of actions that happen inside your head.One of the outcomes they have, either primary or secondary, is the\u00a0regulation of one\u2019s own emotions, as suggested by Wojnarowska et al (2020). You can use \u201cacceptance\u201d for other purposes, such as being more authentic or happy. But I suspect that, for many including me, regulating one\u2019s own emotions is one of the most common, if not the most common, reasons for practising \u201cacceptance\u201d. They are usually found in personal development or mental health related advice.And now, here are the nine types of \u201cacceptance\u201d related advice I\u2019ve found. 2.a. Acceptance as an act of letting go of one\u2019s strugglesObjects to accept: Almost anything that is causing one to struggle or feel frustratedActions to take: To withdraw your commitment to work towards a certain outcome, and allow the current outcome to continue even if you find that undesirable(Or in my layman language) To stop trying to fix or change an issue, and allow the issue to exist even if you don\u2019t like itReferenced in: Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT)\u201cAcceptance does not mean \u2018putting up with\u2019 or resigning yourself to anything. Acceptance is about embracing life, not merely tolerating it. Acceptance literally means \u2018taking what is offered\u2019. It doesn\u2019t mean giving up or admitting defeat; it doesn\u2019t mean just gritting your teeth and bearing it. It means fully opening yourself to your present reality\u2014acknowledging how it is, right here and now, and letting go of the struggle with life as it is in this moment.\u201d (Harris, 2007) How is this advice different from dictionary definitions? The definitional equivalent of the act of tolerating or giving in is used here, but things that cause frustration are the primary objects of \u201cacceptance\u201d.2.b. Acceptance as an act of receiving subjective experiences without resistingObjects to accept: Subjective experiences like emotions or thoughts that are usually negativeActions to take: To observe the emotion or thought, receive it without changing or resisting it, and let it passReferenced in: Vedic or Buddhist inspired mindfulness\u201cTraditional Buddhist meditation manuals describe mindfulness as paying attention to what we experience, not what we would like to experience. In short, mindfulness implies friendly acceptance of the totality of our changing experience rather than avoidance or manipulation of experience.\u201d (David et al., 2013) \u201cTo practice nonattachment is to accept that the objects of experience wax and wane, and that to allow them to come and go naturally is preferable to any attempt to control or retain them\u201d (Williams & Lynn, 2010) Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT)\u201cMindfulness is the defused, nonattached, accepting, nonjudgmental, deliberate awareness of experiential events as they happen in the moment.\u201d (Hayes & Smith, 2005) \u201cRadical Acceptance\u201d\u201cBy accepting absolutely everything, what I mean is that we are aware of what is happening within our body and mind in any given moment, without trying to control or judge or pull away. I do not mean that we are putting up with harmful behavior\u2014our own or another\u2019s. This is an inner process of accepting our actual, present moment experience. It means feeling sorrow and pain without resisting. It means feeling desire or dislike for someone or something without judging ourselves for the feeling or being driven to act on it.\u201d (Brach, 2003)\u201c \u00a0\u201cRadical acceptance\u201d is not an academic or technical term, but I\u2019m including it anyway since the book where this term came from is rather popular.How is this advice different from dictionary definitions? The definitional equivalents of (a) the act of receiving and (b) the act of tolerating or giving in are used here, but subjective experiences are the primary objects of \u201cacceptance\u201d.2.c. Acceptance as an act of suspending value judgementsObjects to accept: Almost anything that elicits a negative value judgement, such as:One\u2019s personhood or specific parts about a person (e.g., appearance, \u00a0emotions, even the value judgement itself, etc)Situations one might find themselves in (e.g., a loss, a conflict, uncertainty, etc)External environments one reside in (e.g., poverty, a flawed democratic system, lookism, etc)Information one receives (e.g., feedback, a counterargument, a rejection, etc)Actions to take: To suspend one\u2019s judgement, or to withhold judgementTo observe the value judgement, receive it without changing or resisting it, treat it in a non-serious and lighthearted manner, and let it pass (somewhat similar to the acceptance of subjective experiences)Referenced in: Vedic or Buddhist inspired mindfulness\u201cNonjudgment involves describing stimuli rather than adding evaluations of them. Nonjudgment is a central component of mindfulness meditation, and can be found in the Zen concept of fushizen-fushiaku, literally \u201cnot thinking good, not thinking bad,\u201d which represents a transcendence of distinguishing phenomena as good and bad\u201d (Fischer-Schreiber et al., 1991, as cited in Williams & Lynn, 2010) \u00a0However, non-evaluative acceptance may not be practice in all or most schools of Buddhism. And it may in fact be a secular or Western interpretation of Sati (or mindfulness). I\u2019m not entirely sure myself, but I\u2019m leaving the following quote here for now.\u201cThis is why evaluation\u2014judging the best way to maximize the pleasure of the breath\u2014is essential to the practice. In other words, you don\u2019t abandon your powers of judgment as you develop mindfulness. Rather, you train them to be less judgmental and more judicious, so that they yield tangible results.\u201d (Bhikkhu, 2016) Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT)\u201cObviously, the ability to judge is vital to our wellbeing. But as we have already seen, many of the mind\u2019s judgements are extremely unhelpful. All too often they set us up for a struggle\u2014with ourselves, our feelings or reality itself. As with any unhelpful thought, the aim in ACT is to let such judgements come and go; rather than buying into them, we can simply acknowledge, \u2018It\u2019s a judgement.\u2019\u201d (Harris, 2007) Person-Centred Therapy (PCT)\u201c... It means that he prizes the client in a total rather than a conditional way. By this I mean that he does not simply accept the client when he is behaving in certain ways, and disapprove of him when he behaves in other ways. It means an outgoing positive feeling without reservations, without evaluations. The term we have come to use for this is unconditional positive regard.\u201d (Rogers, 1961) \u00a0Here, I interpret \u201cwithout evaluations\u201d as the lack of value judgement.How is this advice different from dictionary definitions? The definitional equivalents of (a) the act of receiving and (b) the act of tolerating are used here, but things that elicit negative value judgements are the primary objects of \u201cacceptance\u201d.The authors added one new definition or mental move (that isn\u2019t a dictionary definition of \u201cacceptance\u201d) on top of existing dictionary definitions mentioned above:The act of stopping oneself from doing something2.d. Acceptance as an act of treating people kindlyObjects to accept: People, usually when they\u2019re sufferingActions to take: To treat people with concern and dignity, and to support them.Note that I\u2019m less certain whether the act of empathising and giving a warm attitude is a necessary part of compassion, but I thought I should mention that I left these mental moves out.Referenced in: \u201cRadical Acceptance\u201d\u201cThe second wing of Radical Acceptance, compassion, is our capacity to relate in a tender and sympathetic way to what we perceive. Instead of resisting our feelings of fear or grief, we embrace our pain with the kindness of a mother holding her child. Rather than judging or indulging our desire for attention or chocolate or sex, we regard our grasping with gentleness and care. Compassion honors our experience; it allows us to be intimate with the life of this moment as it is. Compassion makes our acceptance wholehearted and complete.\u201d (Brach, 2003) Popular psychology\u201cPerhaps more than anything else, cultivating self-acceptance requires that we develop more self-compassion. Only when we can better understand and pardon ourselves for things that earlier we assumed must be all our fault can we secure the relationship to self that till now has eluded us.\u201d (Seltzer, 2008) How is this advice different from dictionary definitions? None of the dictionary definitions of \u201cacceptance\u201d are used here.The authors created an entirely new definition or mental move (that isn\u2019t a dictionary definition of \u201cacceptance\u201d):The act of treating people kindly or compassionatelyNote that Brach\u2019s (2003) \u201cRadical Acceptance\u201d has both mindfulness and self-compassion components in it, so one could technically interpret that as adding a new definition on top of existing definitions. But I thought it\u2019s more clarifying to separate both mindfulness and self-compassion into their own mental moves.2.e. Acceptance as an act of liking a personObjects to accept: People, or parts of people (e.g., their behaviour, their motives, their feelings, etc)Actions to take: To like a person, or to love a person (if feelings are stronger)(To be more concrete) To give a person a positive value judgement and to find them enjoyable to be withReferenced in: Person-Centred Therapy (PCT)\u201cPutting this in simpler terms, to feel unconditional positive regard toward another is to \"prize\" him (to use Dewey's term, recently used in this sense by Butler). This means to value the person, irrespective of the differential values which one might place on his specific behaviors. A parent \"prizes\" his child, though he may not value equally all of his behaviors. Acceptance is another term which has been frequently used to convey this meaning, but it perhaps carries more misleading connotations than the phrase which Standal has coined. In general, however, acceptance and prizing are synonymous with unconditional positive regard.\u201d (Rogers, 1959) \u00a0Here, I interpret \u201cprizing\u201d as the act of valuing something highly. However, acceptance as used in PCT is usually mentioned as a part of unconditional positive regard (UPR) or just positive regard (which also has a similar meaning to prizing or liking). You can find \u00a0about UPR in the appendix. \u00a0Popular psychology\u201cSelf-acceptance happens through the process of self-discovery and self-awareness. It\u2019s a state we experience when we welcome, include, and take pride in all that we are and all that we\u2019re not yet. When we welcome every part of ourselves, the pressure to perform or suppress our true characters lifts... It\u2019s only when we like ourselves, and care for ourselves like we would a loved one, that we begin to feel that we deserve to be visible and feel we belong.\u201d (Dobson-Smith, 2022) How is this advice different from dictionary definitions? The definitional equivalent of the act of giving positive value judgement is used here, but people are the primary objects of \u201cacceptance\u201d.The authors added one new definition (that isn\u2019t a dictionary definition of \u201cacceptance\u201d) on top of the existing dictionary definition of \u201cacceptance\u201d mentioned above:The feeling of enjoyment2.f. Acceptance as an act of believing that one has unconditional worthObjects to accept: The belief that everyone has intrinsic value or worthActions to take: To believe that there\u2019s intrinsic value or worth in everyone including yourself, even if one believes certain specific behaviours or traits are bad.Note that I interpret the authors below as saying that there is definitely some intrinsic good in each person, but I don\u2019t think they had ever mentioned that every person\u2019s value are equal.Referenced in: Person-Centred Therapy (PCT)\u201cBy acceptance I mean a warm regard for him as a person of unconditional self-worth\u2014of value no matter what his condition, his behavior, or his feelings. It means a respect and liking for him as a separate person, a willingness for him to possess his own feelings in his own way. It means an acceptance of and regard for his attitudes of the moment, no matter how negative or positive, no matter how much they may contradict other attitudes he has held in the past.\u201d (Rogers, 1961) \u00a0Despite also appearing in acceptance as an act of liking a person, I\u2019ve also seen PCT occasionally using acceptance as an act of believing a person has unconditional worth. Specifically, PCT uses these terms more often: positive regard or unconditional positive regard. I\u2019ve written more about it in the appendix. \u00a0Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT)\u201cUnconditional self-acceptance. You always, under all conditions, evaluate your self (your being or your personality) as a valuable, good person. (1) Because you are you (and no one else); (2) because you are alive; (3) because you simply decide to do so; (4) because you acknowledge your \"bad\" traits and dislike them but still accept yourself with these; (5) because you refuse to give any global rating to your you-ness but only rate your thoughts, feelings, and actions as \"good\"-meaning, leading to effective individual and social results; (6) because you believe in some God, who always accepts you with all your failings and has the power to make you a good person; (7) because you use some other unconditional form of total, persistent acceptance of you with all your \"good\" and \"bad\" characteristics and performances.\u201d (Ellis, 2006) \u00a0Technically, REBT has a combination of believing that you have unconditional self-worth, and not giving yourself any evaluation that compares your entire personhood with everyone\u2019s own personhood. But I think the belief in unconditional self-worth is the primary feature of acceptance in REBT. \u00a0Popular psychology\u201cThere is, fortunately, an alternative to self-esteem. It is unconditional self-acceptance. Think of yourself as the crate and all your actions and qualities as the oranges. Your crate \u2013 you \u2013 contains hundreds if not thousands of oranges \u2013 discrete acts and traits accumulated over a lifetime. Many of your oranges (your good deeds and virtuous qualities) are ripe and luscious. But, some are bruised, puny, rotten \u2013 your mistakes and faults. When you run across a damaged orange, you may dislike it, even act to rid yourself of it but you never \u2013 ever \u2013 denigrate or damn your whole crate of oranges.\u201d (Grieger, 2013) How is this advice different from dictionary definitions? The definitional equivalents of (a) the act of giving positive value judgement and (b) the act of believing something as true are used here, but the belief that everyone has intrinsic value or worth are the primary objects of \u201cacceptance\u201d.The authors added one new definition (that isn\u2019t a dictionary definition of \u201cacceptance\u201d) on top of the existing dictionary definition of \u201cacceptance\u201d mentioned above:An unconditionality clause2.g. Acceptance as an act of believing something bad as true without resistingObjects to accept: Information that are known to be true or more true (e.g. facts), but have a side effect of eliciting negative value judgements (e.g., negative feedback, bad news about your loved one\u2019s health, etc)Actions to take: To believe a piece of information as true (or more true) and not change or resist itReferenced in: Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT)\u201cWhat Is Radical Acceptance? 1. Radical means all the way, complete and total. 2. It is accepting in your mind, your heart, and your body. 3. It\u2019s when you stop fighting reality, stop throwing tantrums because reality is not the way you want it, and let go of bitterness. What Has to Be Accepted? 1. Reality is as it is (the facts about the past and the present are the facts, even if you don\u2019t like them). 2. There are limitations on the future for everyone (but only realistic limitations need to be accepted). 3. Everything has a cause (including events and situations that cause you pain and suffering). 4. Life can be worth living even with painful events in it.\u201d (Linehan, 2015-a) \u00a0Not to be confused with Brach\u2019s (2018) \u201cRadical Acceptance\u201d, which is related to the acceptance of one\u2019s subjective experiences. \u00a0Contemporary rationalist communities (like LessWrong or Astral Codex Ten)\u201c... I think most importantly - you should always be striving to accept some particular argument that you feel isn't sinking in. \u00a0Strive to accept \"X implies Y\", not just \"Y\". \u00a0Strive to accept that there are no ghosts because spirits are only made of material neurons, or because the supernatural is incoherent. \u00a0Strive to accept that there's no maniac behind the door because your thoughts don't change reality. \u00a0Strive to accept that you won't win the lottery because you could make one distinct statement every second for a year with every one of them wrong, and not be so wrong as you would be by saying \"I will win the lottery.\" (Yudkowsky, 2009) \u201cWhat is true is already so. Owning up to it doesn\u2019t make it worse. Not being open about it doesn\u2019t make it go away. And because it\u2019s true, it is what is there to be interacted with. Anything untrue isn\u2019t there to be lived. People can stand what is true, for they are already enduring it.\u201d (Gendlin, 2003, as cited in Yudkowsky, 2007) \u00a0Technically, Gendlin is not at all associated with any contemporary rationalist communities. The quote came from Gendlin\u2019s book on Focusing, a type of psychotherapy.How is this advice different from dictionary definitions? The definitional equivalents of (a) the act of believing something as true and (b) the act of tolerating or giving in are used here, but facts that generate negative value judgements are the primary objects of \u201cacceptance\u201d.2.h. Acceptance as believing that one has limited control without resistingObjects to accept: The belief that we only have influence on things that are within our control, and we lack influence to change things that are outside of our controlActions to take: To believe that some things are within our control and some things are outside of one\u2019s control, and focusing on things that are inside of one\u2019s control is betterNote that this is a more specific version of acceptance as an act believing something bad as true. I\u2019ve separate the two, because I\u2019ve seen this use of acceptance a few times and thought it should have its own distinct section.Referenced in: \u201cPopular Stoicism\u201d (in the style of popular-psychology-like content)\u201cWhen we encounter difficult situations, there are often things we can control and things we cannot. The Stoic approach to acceptance teaches us to focus on what we can control and accept what we cannot. This can help us to feel more at peace and in control of our emotions, even when faced with adversity.\u201d (Stoic Simple LLC, n.d.) \u00a0I suspect popular Stoic content creators used \u201cacceptance\u201d as a modern and easier-to-understand interpretation of a certain part of Stoic philosophy. I think I was able to trace this specific type of acceptance to Epictetus (n.d./2014), but I\u2019m not certain, because the word \u201cacceptance\u201d isn\u2019t technically used in the translation. \u00a0Here are some relevant quotes:\u201cWhat are we to do, then? To make the best of what lies within our power, and deal with everything else as it comes. \u2018How does it come, then?\u2019 As God wills.\u201d (Epictetus, n.d./2014) \u201cSome things are within our power, while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing. 2. The things that are within our power are by nature free, and immune to hindrance and obstruction, while those that are not within our power are weak, slavish, subject to hindrance, and not our own. 3. Remember, then, that if you regard that which is by nature slavish as being free, and that which is not your own as being your own, you\u2019ll have cause to lament, you\u2019ll have a troubled mind, and you\u2019ll find fault with both gods and human beings; but if you regard only that which is your own as being your own, and that which isn\u2019t your own as not being your own (as is indeed the case), no one will ever be able to coerce you, no one will hinder you, you\u2019ll find fault with no one, you\u2019ll accuse no one, you\u2019ll do nothing whatever against your will, you\u2019ll have no enemy, and no one will ever harm you because no harm can affect you.\u201d (Epictetus, n.d./2014) How is this advice different from dictionary definitions? The definitional equivalents of (a) the act of believing something as true and (b) the act of tolerating or giving in are used here, but the belief that we have limited control are the primary objects of \u201cacceptance\u201d.2.i. Acceptance as an act of acceptanceObjects to accept: One\u2019s personhood or specific parts about a person (e.g., appearance, \u00a0emotions, mistakes, etc)Actions to take: (This is a circular definition so I\u2019m confused myself\ud83e\udd37.)Referenced in: American Psychological Association (APA)\u201cSelf-acceptance. n. a relatively objective sense or recognition of one\u2019s abilities and achievements, together with acknowledgment and acceptance of one\u2019s limitations.\u201d (American Psychological Association Dictionary of Psychology, n.d.) \u00a0This is probably closer to \u201cacceptance of reality\u201d, but I\u2019m uncertain. \u00a0Popular psychology\u201c[Self-acceptance is] an individual\u2019s acceptance of all of his/her attributes, positive or negative.\u201d (Margado et al., 2014, as cited in Ackerman, 2018, Pillay, 2016) \u201cSelf-acceptance is the act of accepting yourself and all your personality traits exactly as they are. You accept them no matter whether they are positive or negative. This includes your physical and mental attributes.\u201d (Perry, 2021) \u00a0I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s pretty close to acceptance as an act of believing that one has unconditional worth (even if you don\u2019t like parts of yourself).How is this advice different from dictionary definitions? Since the authors used circular definitions to describe \u201cacceptance\u201d, I\u2019m not exactly sure how they\u2019ve used \u201cacceptance\u201d differently.3. Some thoughts and analysis on how \u201cacceptance\u201d is commonly used3.a. How different are dictionary definitions of \u201cacceptance\u201d and definitions of \u201cacceptance\u201d used in advice?Looking at the diagram below (Figure 1), I found that: In terms of distance,4 out of 9 \u201cacceptance\u201d related advice are very close in meaning to the dictionary definition. The only difference is that these advice have a more specific object to practise \u201cacceptance\u201d on.2 out of 9 are somewhat close in meaning. These advice have an added definition that doesn\u2019t take their primary dictionary definition too far away.2 out of 9 are somewhat far in meaning. Both of them have definitions that are not from any dictionary definitions, such as the act of stopping oneself from doing something or the act of treating people kindly.1 out of 9 is \u201cundefined\u201d (?), because it uses a circular definition\u2014acceptance as an act of accepting X.In terms of frequency, the most used dictionary definition, from most to least, are:The act of tolerating or giving in (referenced in 5 types of advice)The act of believing something as true (referenced in 3)The act of giving someone or something a positive value judgement (referenced in 2)The act of receiving something (referenced in 2) Overall, I feel like that most of the \u201cacceptance\u201d related advice given have a pretty similar definition with dictionary definitions. Even the least similar advice (treating people kindly from \u201cRadical Acceptance\u201d) still seem pretty close to \u201cacceptance\u201d in concept space. Despite that, reading about \u201cacceptance\u201d still confused me a lot, perhaps because there\u2019s like nine type of advice that are all subtly-to-moderately different from each other, and some advice has more than one dictionary definition or an entirely new definition inserted. I also think it\u2019s interesting that the \u201cacceptance\u201d definition of the act of tolerating or giving in is probably the most typical type of \u201cacceptance\u201d in advice. Not too surprising, because I had this instinctual vibe that acceptance feels like surrendering yourself to something, so you stop struggling and be less frustrated. 3.b. Do writers often need to point out possible misinterpretations or confusions?Another way to spot how \u201cacceptance\u201d can be a challenging word to use, and I do see some instances of authors clarifying or pointing out subtle differences in \u201cacceptance\u201d and other kinds of confusion. Here are some examples: Confusion between tolerating and giving in Acceptance Commitment Therapy\u201cAcceptance does not mean \u2018putting up with\u2019 or resigning yourself to anything. Acceptance is about embracing life, not merely tolerating it. Acceptance literally means \u2018taking what is offered\u2019. It doesn\u2019t mean giving up or admitting defeat; it doesn\u2019t mean just gritting your teeth and bearing it. It means fully opening yourself to your present reality\u2014acknowledging how it is, right here and now, and letting go of the struggle with life as it is in this moment.\u201d (Harris, 2007) \u00a0Here, Harris probably wanted to clearly delineate these two very-close-in-meaning types of \u201cacceptance\u201d.Confusion between giving in, giving positive value judgement, and believing something as true \u00a0Dialectical Behavior Therapy\u201cThe very concept of accepting the reality of facts that are not in dispute can be difficult for many participants. This is particularly true when participants have been victims of horrific abuse and believe that life has been very unfair to them. A common pattern here is believing that to accept something is to approve [giving positive value judgement] of it or to be passive and not change things [giving in] that are destructive.\u201d (Linehan, 2015-b) \u00a0Linehan probably thought that people often get these three definitions of \u201cacceptance\u201d confused, when she only meant acceptance as an act of believing something as true.Confusion between unconditional and conditional acceptance Person-Centered Therapy\u201cThe phrase \u201cunconditional positive regard\u201d may be an unfortunate one, since it sounds like an absolute, an all or nothing dispositional concept. It is probably evident from the description that completely unconditional positive regard would never exist except in theory. From a clinical and experiential point of view I believe the most accurate statement is that the effective therapist experiences unconditional positive regard for the client during many moments of his contact with him, yet from time to time he experiences only a conditional positive regard...\u201d\u201d (Rogers, 1957) \u201cHowever, its hidden paradox emerges when one critically analyzes Rogers' definition of the self and its relation to behavior. Rogers postulates a self in personality which is separate but causally related to behavior. Herein lies the paradox: if the self is causally related to behavior how can one respond conditionally to the latter without doing likewise to the former since some element of a cause is always inherent in its effects?\u201d (Patrick, 1980) \u201cIt is important to make a distinction between experience and external behavior - between, on the one hand, all my client's feelings, thoughts, fantasies, desires, and, on the other hand, his actual behavior. Unconditionality refers to my acceptance of his experience.\u201d (Lietaer, 2001) Popular psychology\u201c... to fully accept yourself and all of your flaws and mistakes does not mean that you condone any bad behavior or accept and embrace unhealthy or harmful actions... You do not need to condone or approve of your actions, traits, and characteristics to accept that you did engage in those actions and that those undesirable traits and characteristics are a real part of who you are.\u201d (Ackerman, 2018) \u00a0Note that this quote here could also be in point 2 above.3.c. Did the authors achieve what they wanted with the way they defined \u201cacceptance\u201d?Yudkowsky (2008) argues that the purpose of drawing boundaries around words or categories is to figure \u201cwhere to cut reality in order to carve along the joints\u201d, or in my own interpretation, to define words in a way that allows for empirical predictions. The author talks about one could technically put dolphins in a set that are mostly fishes, but putting dolphins in a set that are mostly other aquatic mammals allows one to have a more accurate model of the world (since mammals and fishes are quite different). However, Alexander (2014) suggests that the purpose of drawing boundaries should be about capturing \u201ctradeoffs you care about\u201d. He gave a thought experiment about a time traveller failing to convince King Solomon that whales are a type of mammal and not a fish. The time traveller failed, because the only thing that Solomon cared about was whether whales should be butchered in the coast (where his ministry of fish is located) or butchered inland (where his ministry of legged creatures is located). So in essence, you can define words however you want as long as they are achieving your goals. Without thinking hard about this, I\u2019m leaning closer to Alexander\u2019s stance on this. So, do I think the authors, who gave the bunch of advice above, defined \u201cacceptance\u201d in a way that helps people understand how to regulate emotions better? Overall, I would give them a \"B\" score for the following reasons: What makes the use of \u201cacceptance\u201d in advice more confusing?\u201cAcceptance\u201d as a word already has way too many dictionary definitions (more than six). And of the six I\u2019ve listed, four of them are primarily used in advice. Furthermore, some advice has a mix of different dictionary definitions alongside other non-\"acceptance\" related definitions.There is a glut of \u201cacceptance\u201d related advice\u2014nine different types of advice from ten different sources, and some of them are pretty close in meaning to others.What makes the use of \u201cacceptance\u201d in advice less confusing?Almost all authors did write about concrete level actions to practise \u201cacceptance\u201d. So even if they use \u201cacceptance\u201d at first, they\u2019ll eventually fill you in with the actual actions.So how does one get to an \"A\" score (from me) when talking about \u201cacceptance\u201d? This might be nitpicky, but I would prefer if they gave more close-but-not-similar examples to differentiate the \u201cacceptance\u201d they want to talk about. For example, \u201csome people use \u2018acceptance\u2019 in X, Y, and Z ways, but in this writing, I want to talk about doing it in W way.\u201dOr better, just taboo\u00a0\u201cacceptance\u201d totally (not one word of it) if one is planning to use it.Or even better, someone should write about \u201cSuper Ultra Level 9999 Acceptance\u201d. 9999x more radical than Brach\u2019s \u201cRadical Acceptance\u201d or Linehan\u2019s \u201cradical acceptance\u201d (Dialectical Behavior Therapy). It combines all nine \u201cacceptance\u201d related advice this, plus adjacent virtues like forgiveness, empathy, courage, etc. That way when someone wants to write about \u201cacceptance\u201d, someone else could go, \u201coh didn\u2019t you hear? Someone already wrote about all the different kinds of \u201cacceptance\u201d. There\u2019s no more alpha here.\u201d3.d. So, should one love every part of oneself, even if one likes hurting people?Mostly likely not. But I might write more about this in the future. ReferencesAckerman, C. (2018, July 12).

However, I decided to still include PCT, since it was an influential form of psychotherapy and \u201cacceptance\u201d was mentioned quite consistently as being part of \u201cunconditional positive regard\u201d (UPR)\u2014a necessary feature of doing PCT (Rogers, 1957). Ironically, even the concept of UPR was similarly vague and under-defined (Farber, 2011; Ort et al., 2022; Suzuki & Farber, 2016), making the effort to understand \u201cacceptance\u201d much more challenging. Collating all of the varied definitions of UPR further is beyond the scope of this writing, but for those who are curious, here\u2019s one (modern) interpretation of UPR that is easier to understand. UPR is essentially a merger of two concepts: Positive regard: a combination of positive feelings including care, support, \u00a0respect, liking, affection, validation, warmth, support, and affirmation (Barrett-Lennard, 2015; Farber et al., 2022); andUnconditionality: \u201cthe degree of constancy of [positive] regard felt by one person for another\u201d or \u201chow little or how much variability there is in one person\u2019s affective response to another\u201d (Barrett-Lennard, 2015).

Laila and Bakr are my heartbeat, the light of my life, and my everything.   The horrific story of the recent war in Gaza   Since the beginning of the last war in Gaza, our home has been completely destroyed, forcing us to be displaced. We had to move more than 10 times to find safety. During this harrowing journey, we faced extreme hunger and malnutrition that almost claimed the lives of me and my children.

Author PhD Bajram Red\u017eepagi\u0107 Essay - PLANET EARTH IN A CHAOTIC HELL FROM GLOBAL POLLUTION \" - MOVEMENT FOR THE ECOLOGICAL REVOLUTION \" I invite all the poets of the world to join the movement for the ecological revolution. EARTH The planet is being destroyed by the powerful, the governments of RUSSIA, America, China AND OTHER POWERFUL COUNTRIES that support wars. The Ecological Revolution Movement demands that the governments of the powerful powers transfer the funds intended for armaments to the ECOLOGICAL REVOLUTION MOVEMENT FOR THE SAVE THE EARTH OF THE PLANET AND THE SAVE OF HUMANITY. Here is this hour, I, Bajram Red\u017eepagi\u0107, am waking up from a deep sleep, I am waking up together with all of humanity, I want to speak the truth, I am waking up from darkness and darkness, delusion, in great fear, I am also waking up around me the same mass of the world in fear.. I RISE TO MY FEET AND RAISE MY VOICE FOR THE MOVEMENT FOR THE ECOLOGICAL REVOLUTION, THE ONLY SAVE FOR AN OVERHEATED EARTH. I wake up with HOPE... that humanity wakes up from its drunken state and sleep because the EARTH of the planet is burning in chaotic pollution, poisoned by polluted water, polluted air, polluted food. Children die fed the same poisoned food, water, and air. Humanity's health is threatened, water is running out, life is running out. Sky radiation is increasing day by day due to the disappearance of the ozone layer that protects the planet Earth. Fish are gurgling poisoned in rivers, seas... The world's most powerful military powers invest huge sums of money in lethal weapons, kill innocent young people, and displace families. The artist expresses his view of the environment and the world, and inner emotions, and all inspirations come from higher, heavenly spaces. In every drop of pure water, in every drop of dew on a blade of grass, is the synthesis of Divine creative power. In every song, picture, scientific discovery is God's true word, the essence of life as a reflection of the external opposites that are the Divine miracle of nature. Only in this union of opposites is a new living matter created, which carries within it atoms for millions of years. The future of humanity is in raising a NEW man, INVESTMENT primarily IN EDUCATION of children, whose principles are based on moral obligations.. Absolute criticism is needed, can writers and artists break into the front lines of the rebellion against lies and injustice, against drugs, alcohol, robbery, profit, and freedom should be sought, sought and fought for. A No investment in armaments and investment in the creation of artificial intelligence. This is done by those who have power and might. Humanity CRIES, CRIES ARE HEARD .. to be reborn. In practice, the negative human ego, yet the culprit for all the chaos on earth is a SELFISH MAN eager for PROFIT AND POWER. Let's raise our voices for love, peace and saving the planet earth and humanity from disaster. Because of everything, our Planet EARTH is crying, heating up, hot, sweating, the earth is approaching hell. The division is activated again, the world is divided, Russia / America, / China / Western Europe.. Nuclear war is on the horizon. AWAKENING AND SALVATION! ENLIGHTENED MAN, Why are there no great ideas, heroes, REFORMERS? WHERE ARE the true fighters for morality, love, health, well-being, protecting people from mental and physical illness, and all because of profit, theory of interest, lack of faith in God, trust in the Creator, lack of God's idea of positivism. Waking up from the comfort of a passive sleeper. Youth creates reform, youth and knowledge connect the world, they recognize kindness and love, the world remains on the younger ones, they must condemn evil, How to create a new, young, healthy generation? Wars and violence are the history of humanity. The trauma of memories, hatred and hostility are renewed again and again. Absolute criticism is needed, can writers and artists make their way to the front lines of the rebellion against lies and injustice, against drugs, alcohol, robbery, profit, ALL THAT brought to a boiling point, LOOKS LIKE Hell.  AUTHOR Bajram Red\u017eepagi\u010730.09.2023   \"A STEP TO DEATH - GLOBAL WARMING AND POLLUTION How long I would be half asleepreached the height of the sky,looking for an answer in the immeasurable distance,where only thought does not see the limits of infinity.

It's as if I hear a message neither short nor longDeath is nearIf we lose faith in God,we leftthe trace is deleted.Heaven does not receive us A man in search of goodleaves a trace of eternity. I break time with my palms The deaf darkness envelops me,like I'm getting ready for eternity This is how I will separate myself from unhappiness and pain?Oh god, could this be java?I rubbed my eyes, painfully waking up from an apparent dream,I felt a tremorNumb feelingsFear of death, night without a sound,The mystery of the return!I see fear as big as a mountain,we look at each other under the eyemy fear and meJava escapes meEverything is a secret hidden.

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

The false allegation swiftly circulated over social media, inciting considerable terror and worry among NASCAR fans, family, and the larger NASCAR community. Elliott filed a lawsuit against the massive media outlet after the event, claiming emotional distress and slander due to the inaccurate narrative. \n \nThe abrupt release of the bogus story on Chase Elliott\u2019s death shocked everyone. Elliott allegedly passed away in a horrific accident, according to an unproven story provided by the aforementioned ESPN outlet. The first claim was not confirmed, so the word quickly circulated on social media. The fake news spread to millions of people in a matter of hours, seriously upsetting Elliott\u2019s loved ones. \nChase Elliott corrected the misunderstanding fast on social media. Elliott reassured his supporters and the general public that he was still alive and well in a video that was uploaded to his official Twitter and Instagram accounts. He was clearly rattled as he voiced his disgust over the fraudulent report and the careless spread of unconfirmed information. \n\u201cI am here, I am healthy, and I am alive.\u201d That such a severe and wholly untrue story being disseminated about me is startling and distressing. Elliott said, \u201cThis kind of careless journalism is intolerable.

With a large fan base and a reputation for skill, sportsmanship, and dedication, Elliott is regarded as one of the best players in the game.",

        "summary": "Surprising connection between gut &\u00a0brain.Photo by Jannis Brandt on\u00a0UnsplashThe forced swimming test (FST) is a behavioral experiment tested on mice to check depression. And the impact of antidepressants. Here, the mice try to escape from a deep-water cylinder they\u2019re placed\u00a0in. If they find it impossible to get out, the mice freeze and wait for their end. Showing signs of depression. Researchers measure the time taken by mice to swim to find out how effective antidepressant treatments are. In 2011, Irish scientist John Cryan took this one step\u00a0further. His team fed half their mice with Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB-1, a strain of bacteria good for the\u00a0gut. The mice filled with these gut bacteria not only kept swimming for longer time, their blood also had fewer stress hormones.They also performed better in memory and learning tests compared to the other half of mice without bacteria\u00a0strain.After two years of this study on mice, a 2013 study on humans surprised the entire research community. People who consumed certain gut bacteria for four weeks showed changes in areas of the\u00a0brain.These areas were responsible for processing pain and emotions.Can you imagine? The bacteria invisible to the naked eye has the power to alter your mood and happiness? The book citing these experiments took me by surprise. When I started reading Gut by Giulia Enders, I was left in awe of the surprising world of gut and the crucial role of gut microbes in our\u00a0body. People don\u2019t lie when they say, \u2018Trust your\u00a0gut\u2019. Captured by\u00a0AuthorGutYour gut includes those organs involved in food intake, digestion, and waste elimination\u200a\u2014\u200athe esophagus, stomach, intestines, rectum, and\u00a0anus. The food you eat passes through your food pipe (oesophagus) into your stomach. After digestion it moves to the small intestine to extract nutrients. Stubborn leftovers from here are passed into large intestine. From here passes your\u00a0waste. Inside your gut lies a different world of bacteria, known as gut flora or gut microbes \u2013 whose sole purpose is to make your life\u00a0better. Gut microbes\u00a0live at the junction of the small and large intestines,inside your large intestine,near your rear openings.From the\u00a0bookThe book is a funnier and concise version of your usual biology text\u00a0book. Giulia first laid the foundations by describing the organs\u200a\u2014\u200ahow and why they look the way they do, like your lopsided\u00a0stomachfunctions and interdependence of these organs. For instance, how the esophagus functions. And why its muscle contractions are essential for swallowing.constipation, vomiting, and bowel movements \u2013 what, why, and how to tackle them. The (not so popular) remedies mentioned here are easy to\u00a0apply.Then, she explained various research backed studies about our gut and its impact on our physical and mental\u00a0health. I was surprised by The connection between gut and brain health, based on cues from the experiment I mentioned above. It\u2019s been observed, your gut health influences your brain to make decisions better suited for your wellbeing.Your food cravings sometimes arise when certain types of microbes crave for them! This means the type of food you crave correlates to the quality of microbes you have. If you constantly crave junk food, then you need to pause and reassess your food\u00a0habits.The role of prebiotics and probiotics in maintaining a healthy gut microbiome. If you consume the correct diet, microbes will literally program your body to become healthier. And\u00a0happier.There is a link between gut health and conditions like schizophrenia, diabetes, depression. Good gut bacteria protect you from falling into depression.Consuming antibiotics damages your gut health. Multiple studies show externally fed antibiotics kills some of your beneficial gut bacteria. If you\u2019re one of them, why not look for healthier alternatives? (Under supervision)Gut health differs in babies born through natural delivery versus C-section. Babies born without C-section are exposed to good bacteria when they\u2019re pushed out. These bacteria give initial protection and become predecessors to future microbes. Hence, these babies are less prone to obesity and immunity problems later in life compared to those born via C-section.I took a deliberate attempt not to explain in more detail because I want you to explore the book yourself. You won\u2019t regret, you have my\u00a0word. To be honest with you, I\u2019m still surprised after knowing how tiny organisms inside gut \u2018talk\u2019 to your\u00a0brain. How the type of bacteria is a testimony to your health. How they influence brain to make you \u2018happy\u2019 or \u2018sad\u2019 after inspecting the food you\u00a0eat. The more junk food inside, the more junk bacteria. Healthier food inside, more healthy bacteria. Hi, I am Ankita! I write about self-improvement, books, and\u00a0tech.

        "summary": "Travel is both a luxury and a necessity. Being able to experience new cultures and cuisines, meet new people, and see even a small portion of the world can be transformational. It can also provide the space to relax, recharge, and revitalize the tired mind. However, time away from the usual routine can also lead to some poor habits, which may have the opposite effect on your health. \nAvoiding such pitfalls is as easy as packing your bags, once you learn the art of clothing Tetris. To make the most of your precious vacation days, here are eight tips for better travel for your mental and physical health. \n \n1. Make sure you\u2019re traveling for the right reasons\nThere\u2019s no doubt that traveling is an exciting time, but for many people, it can also be lonely, even if you\u2019re traveling with others \u2013 it\u2019s easy to miss home. Some people might travel to try and escape their problems, which is never a fix, and could end up heightening any anxiety you\u2019re experiencing. Try to resolve those issues first and leave that baggage at home. \n2. Stay calm and prepared to be as stress-free as possible\nTravel can be stressful. From dealing with airport delays to juggling a packed itinerary, it can feel overwhelming from time to time. One of the best tips is to stay organized. Having all your details somewhere you can access easily will help, both digitally and in print, and it doesn\u2019t hurt to confirm any reservations or travel plans in the days before you need them. \nYou\u2019ll also have to accept that some things are out of your control. Be it road closures or bad weather, there will be times when you need to go with the flow and realize that it\u2019s all part of the adventure. \n3. Maintain sleep hygiene\nBetween changing time zones and a change of routine, sleep isn\u2019t always easy when you\u2019re away from home. Try to switch your usual sleep pattern to the current time zone, without napping midday, especially when you first arrive. If you can maintain a basic sleeping pattern while traveling, you should have the energy you need to enjoy your days. Aim for eight hours to help you avoid lagging behind and missing out on the fun.",

From their origins in the Chicago rap scene to their current status as fashion icons, the story of these hoodies is one of cultural impact, innovative design, and trendsetting style. Here\u2019s a look at how GloGang hoodies became streetwear staples. \nOrigins in the Chicago Rap Scene\nChief Keef and GloGang \nThe journey of GloGang hoodies begins with Chief Keef, a pivotal figure in Chicago\u2019s rap scene. As the founder of the GloGang collective, Chief Keef\u2019s influence extended beyond music into fashion. His unique style and brand identity laid the foundation for the GloGang hoodie\u2019s emergence as a streetwear staple. \nEarly Adopters \nInitially, GloGang hoodies were primarily worn by fans and members of the GloGang community. The association with Chief Keef\u2019s music and persona helped establish the hoodie as a symbol of loyalty and affiliation with the GloGang brand. \nDistinctive Design and Branding\nBold Graphics \nOne of the key factors in the hoodie\u2019s rise to prominence is its distinctive design. GloGang hoodies are known for their bold graphics, including eye-catching logos and intricate artwork. These designs are not only visually striking but also help the hoodie stand out in a crowded streetwear market.",

        "summary": "Hey there,   \"I wish I was less happy.\" - No one ever.\u00a0  \u00a0  Life is full of ups and downs, how we handle them is partly up to us, and partly how our brains have been wired to think over the years.  \u00a0  I'm not a therapist or mental health professional, but I do love learning more about it.\u00a0  \u00a0  \"Neurons that fire together, wire together\" is a phrase coined by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949 to describe how neural pathways in the brain form and strengthen through repetition. The more these patterns repeat, the stronger they become in our own minds.\u00a0  \u00a0  The good news is, you can change those patterns through repetition and new patterns.\u00a0  \u00a0  Physical reminders are a powerful way to add reminders to your daily life. Notes on a mirror, journaling affirmations, or wearing physical reminders, like ZOX, can all help shift our thought patterns over time when used correctly.\u00a0  \u00a0  But don't just take my word for it, here's a review left by Nichole, a therapist:  \u00a0  \"While I rarely ever give my clients gifts because it usually is not appropriate, these bracelets are a perfect reminder of what they are working on. I have ordered quite a few and they mean a lot to my clients.\"\u00a0  \u00a0  The positive reminders on ZOX are great for triggering positive thoughts throughout your day. As a physical reminder that's with you from when you wake up to when you go to sleep, it's a great way to incorporate positive reminders.\u00a0  \u00a0  Some therapists even use positive reminders on ZOX to encourage themselves throughout their day when things get tough, like Rebecca, who said, \"I think this is great. I'm a therapist and it's a reminder to never give up and to continue to help others!\"  \u00a0  Clients have loved the reminders so much that they've come back to our site to order more and leave heartwarming reviews like this one, from John.  \u00a0  \"I was given this bracelet by my therapist when I was going through a hard time, whenever I'm having a hard time this bracelet reminds me of what I have to live for\" - My Story Isn't Finished  \u00a0  One of my favorite things about ZOX is that there's a reminder for almost anything you could be going through. Sherry was about to find a great reminder for herself, plus a few for her patients.\u00a0  \u00a0  \"I bought 4 different ones. I am a psychotherapist and have a few patients who are really struggling right now. I bought one for me and three for 3 of my patients so they know I am still here supporting them even though we are only doing phone sessions. Mailed out to them, can't wait to get their reactions next weeks! :)\"  \u00a0  ZOX Really are the best way to uplift anyone, even yourself. If you'd like to find The Perfect Reminder for yourself today, head over to our site and see what speaks to you.\u00a0  \u00a0  Cheers!

Among those affected are born-again believers, who profess Jesus as their Lord and Savior, who at times struggle to experience the joy mentioned in Romans 15:13. \n\n\n\nAs a clinical and a pastoral counselor, through the years I\u2019ve had the privilege of treating many who were feeling like they were living beneath a dark cloud. Others felt like they lacked a sense of meaning and purpose in life. Some just felt flat-out numb, like nothing they did mattered, and proceeded to ask questions such as \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in all of this, anyway?\u201d or \u201cIs this all that there is to life?\u201d \n\n\n\nIn each of these scenarios, the person\u2019s depression looked different. Contrary to popular belief, depression is not a one-size-fits all issue. And in light of Mandisa\u2019s tragic recent passing, and in honor of the incredible courage she has shown through the years in sharing her journey through depression, I want to shed light on this topic and give you practical ways to deal with depression in your own life.",

        "summary": "DEAR ABBY: My mother is toxic. She had a terrible childhood, and she takes it out on me and my younger siblings. I live far away; they live in the same town as she does. If they don't drop everything for her and do what she wants, she calls them selfish. Because I had to leave town to get my life together, I am accused of \"abandoning\" her. I am called selfish and also accused of not loving her. A couple of months ago, we all blocked her on social media because she berates us constantly. We told her to get a therapist. Today, my sister sent me screenshots of Mom berating her again on Facebook. In the texts my sister sent, Mom said she got a psychotherapist who says we are all psychotic. Abby, why wouldn't the therapist see how delusional and toxic my mother is? Why would a therapist feed her delusions? Where do we go from here? Must I block my mom forever and never talk to her again because her therapist won't help her? \u2014 INCREDULOUS IN CALIFORNIA DEAR INCREDULOUS: Your mother may have been less than truthful about seeing a therapist. I doubt she has found a licensed mental health professional who would diagnose you and your siblings as suffering from psychosis without having met you. Perhaps the sister who shared the screenshots can tell you what that mental health professional's name is so you can check their credentials. You left town because you wisely decided to improve your mental health. If you must block your mother and not communicate with her, do not feel guilty for protecting yourself. DEAR ABBY: I have been married for 24 years. We make a good living. I earn considerably more than my husband. From the beginning, he has asked me to split everything with him. (He's not the \"provider\" type.) He views me as a roommate, financially speaking. He was used to having his parents bail him out of financial situations. I am tired of being the provider. I pay half the mortgage and far more on other expenses. I also do all the cleaning, laundry, cooking and dishes, and I've been picking up after him for 24 years. I have a full-time, highly stressful job and come home from work with chores to do. He works from home and takes naps and siestas during the afternoon. He brings nothing to the marriage beyond paying his half of the bills. I am no longer physically attracted to him. You can't blame me. Most women are not attracted to men who cannot provide. We have one child. I can't breathe and would rather die young than grow old in this hopeless, depressing arrangement. I just need validation that I shouldn't be putting up with this. \u2014 PROVIDER IN THE WEST DEAR PROVIDER: I don't know how many other women would tolerate the kind of marriage you have described, but many do. You are entitled to your feelings, but before doing anything rash, it's important that you discuss this with an attorney who specializes in family law. According to the law in the community property golden state of California, your husband could wind up with half of your hard-earned assets.

Ffs its not lying if its to employers or cops and look up ur rights on what they can and cannot ask u many places ban asking about ur record and transportation status and things like that resources will also tell u how they reword sketchy questions so ur prepared \nHey. Take it from a former HR person\u2026 this goes double right now.  I just spent some time putting in some job applications myself (not for HR, lol) and got about 15 interviews. And idk if it\u2019s because of COVID uncertainty or if places just don\u2019t fucking care anymore because they know people are desperate for work, but the amount of straight up illegal shit\u00a0my interviewers asked me was appalling.  (That\u2019s not even counting the questions that were technically\u00a0legal but clearly fishing for information they\u2019re not legally allowed to ask.) A tame example? Two questions into a phone interview, the guy on the other end of the line asked:\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  I said\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d - giving him a chance to rethink that.  He didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  \u201cSir, you are not allowed to ask me that question.\u201d  \u201cWell, I want to know. I\u2019m asking.\u201d  \u201cAnd you\u2019re legally not allowed to ask me that. I\u2019m not required to tell you my age.\u201d  At that point, I guess he managed to remember an old HR bulletin or something (I hope to god he wasn\u2019t actually HR himself), and he said,\u00a0\u201cWell, I need to know if you\u2019re over the age of 18.\u201d (Which is what he should have asked in the first place\u2026 or not, since that was in the application that he could have read.)  \u201cYes. I\u2019m over the age of 18.\u201d\u00a0  And we moved on. Two questions later, he tried another illegal question. I called him on it again and ended the interview, citing that a workplace with such a clear disregard for the law, especially upon first contact with a potential employee, was not going to be a good fit. (They offered me the job anyway, lol. I didn\u2019t send a thank-you or a response.) At a different interview, the majority of questions were\u00a0\u201cfishing\u201d questions - just looking for that info they\u2019re not actually allowed to ask. (This person was also either not really HR or an HR person who was exceptionally bad at their job.) I could tell they were getting frustrated when I dodged answering the personal stuff, and they actually got extremely\u00a0upset when I mentioned later in the interview (re: less relevant work experience) I had worked in HR. They were super flustered for the remainder of our time, and I watched them skip over questions on their sheet they had clearly planned on asking. They KNEW they were being sketchy and were counting on me not knowing anything about HR - or my rights - and so they got upset when I did.  These were super tame\u00a0examples. I\u2019m begging you, if you\u2019re job searching right now, PLEASE\u00a0know your rights. Please know what interviewers are allowed to ask.  Please don\u2019t volunteer information or elaborate more than you\u2019re required to about personal things. Save your words (and everyone\u2019s time) by elaborating why you\u2019re good for the position/what you can do.  I may create a resource list on this shit later but PLEASE PLEASE KNOW THIS STUFF BEFORE YOU TALK TO AN EMPLOYER. This goes for anywhere you\u2019re interviewing as well as your current employer. This also goes for HR. HR may be the person you go to when shitty stuff happens, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re your friend (or competent).  They don\u2019t need to know your age (beyond 16+, 18+, or 21+, depending on the job). They don\u2019t need to know your medical history. (For the love of god, do NOT answer the\u00a0\u201chave you been diagnosed with depression?\u201d question.) They don\u2019t need to know if you have kids or whatever. They don\u2019t need to know a LOT of those things that may appear on an application, including your veteran status, whether you\u2019re on/have been on unemployment, etc. They\u2019re not entitled to know specifics about your transportation (unless you\u2019re using that transportation for the job, like Uber/delivery drivers). Look this up for your state/the job\u2019s state.  Beware questions like\u00a0\u201cWhat year did you graduate?\u201d if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t put dates on your resume (I just put amount of time spent at employers, not dates of employment). They\u2019re fishing for your age. It\u2019s \u201cOh, you know, 100 years ago,\u201d if you feel comfortable making a joke, or\u00a0\u201cAbout [generic number, like 5 or 10] years ago\u201d if not.  Also beware things like the\u00a0\u201cWhat do you do in your free time?\u201d question, even if you already work there. This is not a friendly getting-to-know-you question. This is a basis for judgement. Not up to an invisible standard? They\u2019re going to be biased against you for pay raises, promotions, etc. Mention kids/lots of family/social engagements? That\u2019s a tick against you for not being the kind of person who lives to work (yes, it\u2019s gross and stupid). Mention lots of solitary things? Cool, that\u2019s their mental note to ask more from you because you\u2019re\u00a0\u201cnot doing anything anyway.\u201d By all means, be friendly with your coworkers/talk about shared interests if you want, but it is none\u00a0of your boss\u2019s business, and be aware what could get back to them.\u00a0  Don\u2019t. Tell. Employers. Shit.   \nWe wrote up a handy list of those illegal questions here: 10 Questions You Should Never Be Asked in a Job Interview\u00a0 \n\n\nHopefully people already know this by now, but I saw way too often back when I worked in retail. Don\u2019t add your coworkers or boss on social media. Yes, your coworkers too. You don\u2019t want to accidentally say something to them or have them see a post and mention it to your boss.

This can cause you a great deal of distress, as you try to figure out what may have gone wrong. In this article, you will find information on the common reasons for these animals not eating. You will also find information on what to do about a hedgehog that won\u2019t eat. \nWhat could be the possible reasons for hedgehog not eating? In some cases, it can be due to stress. There are also cases where it is due to illness, parasites, dental problems or dehydration. A hedgehog may also not eat if it is provided with poor quality food or if hedgehog is in a new environment. \nWe also have cases that hedgehogs that are about to go into hibernation mode (or that are coming out of hibernation mode) may not eat. \nHedgehog not eating\nSometimes, to get the hedgehog eating again, all you have to do is change the food. At other times, you may just need to change when and/or how you present the food. But there are also times when you need to take the hedgehog to a vet. The vet then treats any underlying medical conditions, in order to get the hedgehog eating again. \n\u00a0 \nWhy Is My Hedgehog Not Eating?\nOne possible reason for your hedgehog not eating may be that he is in a new environment. When a hedgehog is in a new place, it will normally not eat for the first few days, as it acclimatizes. \nAnother possible reason for your hedgehog not wanting to eat may be stress. This stress may be on account of loud noises (especially if those are new loud voices that were previously not there). The stress may also be due to confinement in a cage that is too small, or even due to cold drafts. Stress often makes hedgehogs stop eating. \nYet another possible reason for your hedgehog not wanting to eat may be because you are giving it unpalatable food. Or it could be that you are presenting the food in a manner that makes it hard to access for the hedgehog.",

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

        "summary": "3 ViewsThose who want to get rid of drug and alcohol must normalize their lives and enroll in the right drug and alcohol rehab center. Seminal comforts greatly determine the comfort, health, and results of the treatment-providing process in a facility. Although every center may have different characteristics that set them apart, some things are considered fundamental in ensuring that aconducive environment for the patients to recuperate is put in place. \nHere are must-have amenities in drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers:\nComfortable Accommodations \nAffordable rooms are essential in ensuring the rehab center achieves its core objectives. Patients require a comfortable and infection-free environment to concentrate on healing. Cohesion and identity are also promoted through clean, private, or semi-private spaces with good beds, storage, and privacy, preventing patients from feeling like the hospital is an invasion of privacy. Comfortable lodgings can contribute towards client comfort, and thus, less concern from disturbing aspects and center on the treatment and healing aims. \nMedical and Psychological Support \nQualified medical and psychological care is necessary for people in an Orange County rehab center. This comprises round-the-clock medical services, mental health services, and the possibility of individual, group, and couples therapy services. Detoxification procedures are necessary but should be done under a doctor\u2019s supervision. Therefore, such programs must be successful. The patient\u2019s constant psychological treatment enables them to manage psychological disorders and build effective coping skills in the long run to maintain the health of the patients. \n\u00a0Nutritious Meals for the Elderly and the Diet Support \nExcept for education, patients\u2019 nutrition is also one of the most critical components that define their ability to recover. There should be adequate, healthy food presented in the rehabilitation centers that should be respected to meet the patient\u2019s nutritional requirements. There should be nutritionists or dietitians who would help in preparing the meals that are suitable for patients who are healing. It is possible to improve physical health and mental state, contributing to a successful rehabilitation by paying attention to the diet. \nRecreational and Fitness Facilities \n\u00a0Exercise and leisure opportunities are critical parts of alcohol and drug rehabilitation services. People should havea fitness center, yoga classes, and other possible physical activities like hiking or swimming. It is important to note that besides focusing on encouraging physical activities, these activities also offer productive methods of handling stress and anxieties. Patient entertainment reduces a patient\u2019s level of depression, increases self-esteem, and creates habits that can be incorporated into a patient\u2019s daily life after discharge from the center.",

        "summary": "The topic I had chosen for this week\u2019s entry, originally, was focusing solely on missing my skinnier body since I\u2019ve been gaining (oooohh a whole 5lbs but still too much for my kind), but then the day I started writing this, I woke up super early anxious since I had a weekend full of plans but no time for my usual routine for groceries and cleaning (which bring me peace, plus realizing I had forgotten about plans next weekend that I hadn\u2019t sorted out in my mind! I was spiralling and couldn\u2019t stop! I had to start finding workarounds to the things I needed to do in order to alleviate my mind! The worst part is that most of the things I\u2019m stressing over are things that I expect myself to complete no one else is pressuring me to get these done by a certain hour or anything!!! So, why can\u2019t I calm myself down? I mean, most of those things I do because they help my weeks be easier and because they can my mind seeing the organization and the cleanliness. So, it is kind of important to me which is why I prioritize them! Then I weighed in and noticed I had gained and I spiraled again. Completely hating the situation \u2013 my kind and my body alike. I hate how \u201cbig\u201d I am right now and miss my smaller body so much! I hate how I\u2019m swelling and how I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m losing since the rest of my body is showing signs of losing fat but the scale doesn\u2019t reflect this?!? Why not?!? Why is it that the universe is torturing me?! Why can\u2019t I for once get what I want? Next weekend\u2019s plans also include potentially wearing a bathing suit, which I haven\u2019t done in front of anyone who actually knows me. I\u2019ve only done it alone when I\u2019m travelling the world. J don\u2019t actually do it in front of family and friends. So, I\u2019m super worried on both ends of the spectrum\u2026 no one has seen how small my body is but at the same time what if my legs are swelling and they look all puffed up and deformed?! That\u2019s so gross!!! How the heck am I going to hide that?!? Fuck me!!!! Ugh!!! I\u2019m honestly panicking that they\u2019ll be worried at how much I\u2019ve lost but also disgusted with how swollen and puffed up my legs can get with just sitting there with them hanging! Or even out straight as I learned last weekend (but I think it\u2019s the pressure it adds to my muscles that stops the circulation. Then, a friend is in town and she wants to do dinner on Thursday and it interferes with my workout. Of course, knowing me, rather than allowing myself the day off, I\u2019m going to wake up at 5AM to be able to fit in a workout before the day starts. There\u2019s no way I can allow not having a day off right now. I\u2019m not able to have a steady enough weight for me to be comfortable with having a da off. My swelling is too much and it\u2019s too intense for me to be able to allow such a thing!!! Oh and of course, what is that day also? Measurements with my before and afters! So, of course, the size of my body is weighing on my mind! I\u2019m honestly panicking at the fact that I\u2019ll be bigger!!! The odd part of all of this, even though last week I was I was complaining about my boss and her expectations of me, this week she made a comment and, I honestly, could care less! Isn\u2019t that insane but really my mind can\u2019t handle it, it\u2019s\u2026 picking your battles \u2013 anxiety edition\u2026 month 81 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always, I\u2019ll begin with my usual monthly overview. Well, as you have all been seeing and reading over the past several posts, I have been struggling desperately with the way my body has been lately. I have been yo-yo-ing with my weight fluctuations (now, let\u2019s take this into actual real life perspective, the fluctuations that I am complaining about here are actually only a 1-2lbs gain or loss, it\u2019s really not much of a fluctuation and as most of you know, this is normal and typical in our bodies given the various things that affect our bodies on a daily basis\u2026 food, salt, stress, workouts, weather, etc\u2026 so, in reality, I shouldn\u2019t be panicking but I still am because this is how my brain functions). I was extremely nervous again this month since my legs had been so bad in the days leading up to this measurement day. Well, here\u2019s the \u201chilarious\u201d reality \u2013 I\u2019m only a smidge heavier than I was last month (which is literally identical to the weight I\u2019ve been the past few months for my measurement days). All of my measurements, with the exception of my thighs, were all literally the exact same as they were last month. Isn\u2019t that ironic? Here I was freaking out and panicking and worrying about what it\u2019s going to show when I measure and put it down on paper, and it\u2019s not even an issue. The 0.2lb difference in my weigh in doesn\u2019t surprise me since I did measure a 0.25\u201d gain in my thighs measurements. The slight relief that is alleviating my mind momentarily is the fact that I\u2019m actually slightly lower compared to my weigh in from yesterday (yes, I weigh in every single day but my measurements are only once a month). Seeing that my numbers are the same as they have been for the past few months raises other questions that are now crossing my mind\u2026 did I really gain this much, this quickly that now that I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m gaining still, I\u2019m actually maintaining? This is the part that I\u2019m perplexed with trying to define. How is it that at this moment I feel like I\u2019m gaining but in reality, I\u2019m still at the exact same weight and measurements I recorded last month? What is actually going on in my mind? In my body? What is my mind seeing that isn\u2019t actually happening in reality? Why is it that my fluctuations are causing so many moments of anxieties. I mean, it\u2019s so bad that today I woke up at 4:45AM to be able to fit in a workout, my before and after pics, and my measurements this morning because a friend wants to go for dinner this evening and would be interrupting my usual weekday workout routine? The one good thing that I\u2019m looking forward to with being out of the apartment this evening is the risk and the temptation of having too much gum and pops in order to just survive through the evening without actually increasing any of my daily allowed food amount. This still is a thing for me even though I\u2019m quote-unquote in recovery. I haven\u2019t been able to increase by a lot. I have been adding protein and that is something that is happening every single day\u2026 even on Fridays, my one day when I don\u2019t workout. Having protein on the day I don\u2019t workout is actually the hardest thing for me to do every single week since normally I justify the calories based on the fact that I did a workout. Since I don\u2019t workout on Fridays, I panic on how this is going to affect my weigh in the next day. There are also other effects that my body goes through on Fridays that impact my Saturday weigh ins so it\u2019s always the hardest day for me. I can\u2019t even seem to properly track my weigh ins in my mind each day and clearly I\u2019m forgetting my monthly trends.",

        "summary": "Vikas Dubey, who claimed to have been entangled in an unusual series of multiple snake bites in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Fatehpur, is once again in the spotlight. Dubey claimed to have been bitten by a snake several times, with a peculiar belief surrounding the ninth bite potentially being fatal. He alleged that a snake appeared in his dream, foretelling survival after eight bites but indicating impending death upon a ninth. Despite his assertions, medical professionals are attributing his experiences to severe ophidiophobia, commonly known as a fear of snake bites. \nShedding light on the incident, Dr Rajiv Nayan Giri, Chief Medical Officer of Fatehpur, explained that upon reviewing Vikas\u2019s case, it was evident he suffered from ophidiophobia, a fear of snake bites. Dr Giri clarified that according to Dubey, surviving eight snake bites suggests the ninth would be fatal. However, he emphasised that ophidiophobia itself does not cause death; rather, extreme fear could potentially lead to conditions like heart attacks or strokes. Nevertheless, if such complications do not arise, survival after subsequent bites is feasible. \n \nUpon learning of this case, the medical team reached out to Vikas Dubey and his family twice, urging them to come to the district hospital for comprehensive treatment under secure conditions. The team ensured surveillance with CCTV cameras and stationed guards for their safety. Despite the efforts, the family did not avail themselves of this facility. In addition to medical professionals, the doctors consulted a snake charmer who confirmed through tests that Vikas Dubey indeed suffered from a severe phobia, Dr Giri explained. \nRegarding the possibility of Dubey surviving a ninth bite, Dr Giri speculated that recovery could alleviate his phobia over time, citing examples from psychiatric cases where psychological beliefs can influence physical health outcomes. However, he cautioned that untreated psychiatric conditions often persist despite individual incidents of survival. \nWhen asked about Dubey\u2019s death, Dr Giri questioned that when no snake bite took place, how would death even occur. It\u2019s merely a fear, he said, further stating that Ophidiophobia is prevalent in European countries where snake encounters are frequent, affecting one in ten individuals. Similar cases exist in India, where individuals believe they are targeted by snakes. Instances like Vikas\u2019s are seen among those who may be psychologically vulnerable. Without proper treatment, such individuals may endure prolonged anxiety and fear, he further explained. \nDr Giri stated that if Vikas survives a ninth snake bite, it is possible he could be cured of his phobia. He noted that Vikas is currently at the Balaji temple in Rajasthan, where he is placing his faith in a higher power. Given that phobia is a psychological condition and that faith and trust in a higher power are also mental beliefs, surviving another bite might help him gradually overcome his fear and potentially resolve his phobia. \nDr Sandeep Govil, a psychiatrist at Yashoda Multispeciality Hospital in Kaushambi (UP), explained that while snake venom can significantly alter a person\u2019s physical and mental state, the case of Vikas Dubey dif not involve actual snakebites. Instead, his condition was rooted in psychological issues. Dr Govil explained that, from a psychiatric perspective, death from a ninth snakebite is unlikely. Although Dubey may experience stress, anxiety, and fear, these are not expected to lead to death. \n \nDr Govil explained that within psychiatry, there exists a condition known as hypochondriasis where affected individuals often believe they are suffering from serious illnesses, frequently seeking out medical opinions to validate their fears. Vikas Dubey\u2019s situation mirrors this pattern closely. Medically speaking, Vikas\u2019s fixation on snakebites signifies a manifestation of psychiatric illness.",

The largest study of its sort emphasizes how valuable it may be to use Fitbit sleep data that is collected over time for research on health and\u00a0illness. They can all agree that getting a good night\u2019s sleep is crucial, but most individuals might not be aware of the long-term health effects of daily fluctuations in sleep duration and quality. Based on data from Fitbit users, a recent study published in Nature Medicine provides insight into the ways that sleep regularity, quality, and length affect a variety of health consequences. Researchers from Google, the NIH\u2019s All of Us Research Program, and Vanderbilt University Medical Centre collaborated on the largest study of its kind to date. This work deviates from earlier sleep research, which were frequently small-scale and focused on self-reported sleep diaries, short-term movement monitor sessions, or costly in-lab sleep studies that lasted for a short\u00a0while. Rather, the study was based on about 6.5 million sleep nights gathered over an average of 4.5 years of wear from over 6,700 Fitbit sleep data users who were part of the All of Us Research\u00a0Program. Fitbit sleep data\u00a0analysisThe study does not concentrate on a specific group of health outcomes; rather, it examines the connections between sleep and the full range of human diseases. Six major conclusions from the studies on the effects of sleep on people\u2019s health are as\u00a0follows: Sleep duration: A substantial reduction in the likelihood of obesity and sleep apnoea was found for every additional hour of sleep. It has been discovered that numerous illnesses are linked not only to insufficient sleep but also to excessive sleep. Sleep stages: Heart health and mental wellness appear to be significantly impacted by the balance of REM, light, and deep sleep, as indicated by Fitbit sleep\u00a0data. Sleep disturbances: Elevations in the Fitbit restlessness measure have been associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism and sleep difficulties. Sleep irregularity: A variety of problems affecting almost all organ systems have been linked to irregular sleep patterns. High blood pressure, obesity, psychiatric problems (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder), and migraine headaches were found to have strong correlations with irregular sleep patterns. Demographic variations: The study discovered notable variations in the median amount of sleep time among various groups. For instance, White participants slept longer than Black participants, and women tended to sleep longer than men. This emphasises that when studying and improving sleep health, individual variables and potential health inequities must be taken into\u00a0account. Lifestyle role: The research discovered a correlation between variations in sleep duration and lifestyle factors such as alcohol and tobacco use. This emphasises how interrelated health behaviours are and how crucial it is to address a variety of lifestyle factors in order to enhance sleep and general well-being. The study also provided a very fascinating look at the typical time that people sleep. The average time for participants to fall asleep was 11:10 pm, and throughout their primary sleep window of the day, they slept for almost 6.7 hours. A considerable number of people even sneak in a nap in the afternoon, usually about\u00a02:30. Although the purpose of this study is not to propose Fitbit sleep data as a therapeutic tool, we believe that some of these findings will demonstrate to researchers the value of using affordable wearables and sleep monitors to investigate the potential effects of changing sleep patterns on population health over\u00a0time. The study also serves as a reminder that getting regular sleep is just as crucial as getting enough\u00a0sleep. A Complete Guide to Fitbit Sleep\u00a0DataSleep is essential to health. Wearable technology makes sleep tracking easier and more enlightening. Wearable fitness technology leader Fitbit offers thorough sleep tracking to help customers understand and improve their sleep patterns. Fitbit sleep data, interpretation, and sleep improvement strategies will be covered in this\u00a0guide. How Fitbit Sleep\u00a0DataFitbits measure sleep stages via heart rate and accelerometers. Fitbit Sleep Data can identify if you\u2019re asleep, waking, or experiencing different sleep\u00a0stages. Fitbit Sleep Data\u00a0StagesFitbit tracks four sleep\u00a0stages: Nighttime awakeness.Light sleep is non-REM when your heart rate slows and you\u00a0relax.Immune function and recovery depend on deep sleep, the most peaceful non-REM\u00a0state.Memory and learning depend on dreaming and REM\u00a0sleep.Understanding Sleep\u00a0ScoreFitbit\u2019s Sleep Score evaluates sleep quality. This score is 0\u2013100 and based\u00a0on: Total sleep\u00a0time.Restoration: Deep and REM sleep duration.Consistency and balance of sleep\u00a0stages.The Meaning of Your Sleep\u00a0Score.Great (90\u2013100): Your sleep is restful and regulated.Good (80\u201389): Restful sleep with few disruptions.Fair (60\u201379): Your sleep could be enhanced for greater\u00a0repair.Poor (<60): Restorative sleep requires significant improvements.Detailed Sleep\u00a0AnalysisSleep Time: Total sleep time per night. Adults should sleep 7\u20139 hours per night, per\u00a0Fitbit. In Bed vs. Asleep: This measure relates in-bed time to sleep time. Significant differences may suggest sleep disruptions or trouble falling\u00a0asleep. Sleep Regularity: Sleep quality is affected by schedule consistency. Fitbit measures bedtime and wake-up time to promote\u00a0sleep. Fitbit measures HRV during sleep: To assess autonomic nervous system function. Better health and recovery are linked to higher\u00a0HRV. Improve Sleep Using Fitbit: Fitbit monitors your sleep and provides personalized advice to improve\u00a0it. Establish Sleep Routine: The same bedtime and waketime enhances your body\u2019s schedule and sleep consistency. Make Bedtime Relaxing: To relax your body, try reading, meditating, or having a warm bath before\u00a0bed. Optimize Sleep Environment: Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cold for sleep. Buying a comfy mattress and pillows can also improve\u00a0sleep. Restrict Screen Time: Phones, tablets, and laptops emit blue light that disrupts melatonin. Avoid screens an hour before\u00a0bed. Watch Your Coffee and Alcohol: Caffeine and alcohol affect sleep. Reduce intake, especially before\u00a0bed. Fitbit Premium Improves Sleep\u00a0InsightsAdvanced features like: Fitbit Premium provides deeper insights and assistance.Personalized Sleep Reports: Long-term sleep analysis.Guided programs: Customized sleep programs.Advanced sleep metrics include respiration and oxygen saturation.ConclusionSleep tracking from Fitbit helps you understand and improve sleep.

        "summary": "In a world where high-intensity workouts and fad diets dominate the fitness landscape, it's easy to overlook the simplicity and effectiveness of walking for weight loss. With so many complex fitness routines promising quick results, the humble act of walking often gets sidelined. However, this low-impact activity, which you can do anywhere without needing special equipment, can be a game-changer for those seeking a sustainable, enjoyable, and effective way to shed pounds. That's why I've curated my #1 walking workout for weight loss that'll transform your cardio routine. \nWhether you aim to lose weight, improve your cardiovascular health, or incorporate more movement into your daily routine, walking offers many benefits without the intensity of more strenuous workouts. Allow me to guide you through the myriad benefits of walking for weight loss, delve into different walking workouts, and present a structured plan to help you maximize your results. By the end, you'll have all the tools to make walking a pivotal part of your fitness journey. \nThe Benefits of Walking for Weight Loss\n \nWalking is one of the most underrated exercises for weight loss. It's low-impact, suitable for people of all fitness levels, and incredibly effective at boosting your metabolism. \nWhen you walk briskly, your body burns calories more efficiently, helping to create the calorie deficit needed for weight loss. Moreover, walking is easier on the joints than running or high-intensity interval training (HIIT), reducing the risk of injury while delivering excellent cardiovascular benefits. \nCardio exercises like walking increase your heart rate, boosting your metabolism. This metabolic boost helps you burn calories during the walk and keeps your metabolism elevated for hours afterward. \nRELATED: 10 Ways To Maximize Your Walking Workout for Faster Weight Loss \nAdditionally, walking can help improve your mood and energy levels, making staying motivated and consistent with your weight-loss efforts more manageable. Walking releases endorphins, which are natural mood lifters, helping to reduce stress and anxiety. The release of endorphins can lead to better sleep and overall mental well-being, creating a positive feedback loop that supports your weight loss journey. \nPlus, it's an activity you can easily incorporate into your daily routine, whether a morning stroll, a lunchtime walk, or an evening hike. Walking doesn't require a gym membership or fancy equipment\u2014just a good pair of shoes and a bit of determination.",

The order directs state agencies to remove thousands of tents and makeshift shelters along freeways, shopping center parking lots, and city parks - and puts the decision in the hands of local authorities. Newsom's EO comes after a decision by the Supreme Court earlier this summer which allows cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces,\u00a0AP\u00a0reports. The case was the most significant on the issue to come before the high court in decades and comes as cities across the country have wrestled with the politically complicated issue of how to deal with a rising number of people without a permanent place to live and public frustration over related health and safety issues. \"We must act with urgency to address dangerous encampments,\" Newsom said in a statement. The Supreme Court's decision is related to a lower court's ruling on a case known as Grants Pass, which blocked cities from clearing encampments. Earlier this week we noted that\u00a0San Francisco has already taken steps\u00a0to craft policies which allow officials to begin sweeping encampments, according to Mayor London Breed. As the\u00a0Epoch Times\u00a0reports, officials are contemplating options with the city attorney\u2019s office and more information will be shared soon, according to Ms. Breed. \u201cThis decision by the Supreme Court will help cities like San Francisco manage our public spaces more effectively and efficiently,\u201d Ms. Breed said in a June 28\u00a0press release. \u201cThis decision recognizes that cities must have more flexibility to address challenges on our streets.\u201d She said discussions underway aim to reduce homelessness while finding people mental health treatment and services to improve the quality of life for all San Franciscans. \u201c[Illegal camping] is not healthy, safe, or compassionate for people on the street, and it\u2019s not acceptable for our neighborhoods,\u201d Ms. Breed said. One San Francisco local said he supports increased enforcement because of what he described as \u201cfilthy\u201d conditions in some areas. \u201cThe city has become known for feces on the sidewalks and dirty streets,\u201d John Walker told The Epoch Times July 22. \u201cSomething needs to be done.\u201d After the high court\u2019s ruling was announced in June, the state\u2019s Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals quickly moved to discontinue the injunction blocking homeless camp sweeps. San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu said the legal changes will allow the city to better manage its streets and improve public safety.",

Psychotherapy Coaching offers a unique approach to helping individuals navigate challenges and achieve personal growth. This blog post will delve into the importance of Psychotherapy Coaching Sydney and how it contributes to a flourishing society. \nUnderstanding Psychotherapy Coaching\nPsychotherapy coaching combines the principles of traditional psychotherapy with the dynamic coaching approach to provide a holistic pathway towards healing and personal achievement. This modality aims to help individuals navigate their mental health challenges while also setting and achieving personal and professional goals. \nCombining therapeutic techniques and proactive coaching empowers individuals to overcome barriers that hinder their psychological well-being and progress. Integrating these approaches facilitates a deeper self-understanding, equipping people with practical tools and strategies for coping with life\u2019s demands, thus promoting a healthier, more balanced lifestyle. This personalised support system catalyses lasting change, enabling individuals to lead more fulfilling lives. \nThe Impact of Mental Health on Society\nMental health conditions have significant societal implications, influencing various domains, from public health systems to economic stability. When individuals face mental health challenges without adequate support, it can lead to a decline in workplace productivity and increase societal costs due to healthcare expenditure and social welfare needs. Moreover, mental health issues can exacerbate social inequalities, affecting the most vulnerable populations disproportionately. \nPsychotherapy coaching in Sydney seeks to mitigate these impacts by offering tailored support, thereby enhancing the resilience of individuals and communities. Addressing mental health proactively fosters a more supportive and empathetic society where individuals can thrive, contributing to overall societal well-being and economic prosperity. \nAccessibility of Psychotherapy Coaching in Sydney\nPsychotherapy coaching in Sydney is readily available to those seeking support, thanks to a diverse range of service delivery models. Both face-to-face and online sessions provide flexibility and choice to suit different lifestyles and preferences. This adaptability ensures that individuals across the city, regardless of their geographical location or schedule constraints, can access quality psychotherapy coaching. \nThe digital option, in particular, has widened the reach, allowing people who might otherwise face barriers to traditional therapy \u2013 such as mobility issues, time constraints, or living in remote areas \u2013 to benefit from professional guidance and support. This inclusivity is pivotal in fostering a society where mental health support is seen as accessible and normalised.",

The Princess of Wales has taken some time off to rest, but there are growing speculations about what might really be going on behind the scenes. The secrecy surrounding her recent surgery has sparked considerable concern and speculation about the seriousness of her condition. The online community has become a hub for people from around the world to share their thoughts, hopes, and reflections on this unfolding situation. One important detail to note is that Carole Middleton, Catherine\u2019s mother, has been particularly anxious about her daughter, closely monitoring her health and providing support. The last time Princess Catherine was seen in public was at Christmas, and with nearly two months having passed since then, some are starting to question if the royal family is hiding something. Many fans around the globe are wondering if Catherine is okay and whether she might have cancer. While it\u2019s understood that the princess is still recovering as planned, the lack of recent photos of her at home is unusual, and her condition remains a mystery. Here\u2019s a look at some of the rumors circulating about her health and recovery: Ectopic Pregnancy: There have been speculations about an ectopic pregnancy, though no confirmation has been given. Cancer Concerns: Although Kensington Palace has denied any talk of cancer, rumors persist, fueled by Catherine's noticeable weight loss, gaunt appearance, and tearfulness. Mental Health or Divorce: Some wild theories suggest that Catherine might be dealing with a mental health crisis or negotiating a significant divorce settlement. Previous Illness Theories: Some have drawn comparisons to Princess Diana, speculating that Catherine might be suffering from an eating disorder, given her thin appearance. Family and Responsibilities: With three children to care for, it\u2019s also possible that Catherine's condition is related to the demands of her role as a mother. Prince William has reportedly been frustrated by the ongoing speculation. Recently, a video from The Princess Royal Foundation was leaked, showing Catherine from last year, which only fueled further speculation. Ultimately, the most likely scenario is what the palace has stated: Princess Catherine is taking the necessary time to recover from her surgery. It\u2019s reassuring that she has been able to maintain a level of privacy during this period. Hopefully, whatever is happening is not as dire as some of the rumors suggest, and she will continue to recover and return to her public duties soon.",

Go eat shit and die. They are in fact in the room with us right now. 4/26/24 - Biden/Harris administration incorporates latest rule to the ACA that includes protections on the basis of sexual orientation and improves pre-existing protections for gender identity, mandating nondiscrimination in health care and insurance coverage for LGBTQ+ Americans. 4/19/24 - Biden/Harris administration finalized a Title IX rule that clarifies the scope of nondiscrimination protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity throughout educational activities and programs. 1/9/24 - Biden/Harris administration reverses Trump/Pence era \u201cLicense to Discriminate\u201d rules. 6/8/23 - Biden personally announces a series of initiatives that include efforts to protect queer and trans foster youth, improve access to mental health services for LGBTQ+ youth and address the rise in hate-fueled violence. 4/26/23 - Biden/Harris administration files lawsuit against the state of Tennessee, challenging the constitutionality of recently enacted legislation banning age-appropriate, medically necessary gender-affirming care for transgender youth.  2/7/23 - Biden uses his SotU address to encouraged Congress to pass the Equality Act \u201cto ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.\u201d 12/13/22 - Biden signs the Respect for Marriage Act, one of the biggest legislative wins in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality in over a decade, guaranteeing federal rights, benefits and obligations of marriages in the federal code for same-sex couples. The legislation also repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and affirmed public acts, records and proceedings should be recognized by all states. 8/4/22 - Biden/Harris administration declares Monkeypox a public emergency and wields federal power to ensure equal access in the distribution of vaccines and treatment. 3/21/22 - Biden/Harris administration takes steps on Transgender Day of Visibility to protect trans Americans that includes issuing passports with an \u201cX\u201d gender marker, streamlining identity verification during the travel experience and providing resources to transgender kids and their families. And that\u2019s just the last two years, without including any educational or research work done towards new policies or educating Americans about LGBTQ identities and politics, like displaying parts of the AIDS quilt in the White House or regularly acknowledging Pride, days of visibility, or other issues within the community.  You may be too young to remember this, but Biden was one of the first major federal-level politicians to support gay marriage, and he dragged Obama along kicking and screaming to the finish line. This administration is one of the strongest allies the LGBTQ community has had. Ever.  For the many many people who do not seem to understand how a government actually works, this doesn\u2019t mean Biden himself came up with these decisions, but they were approved and implemented by Congress because conservatives didn\u2019t have both the presidency and a majority. They desperately want the white house right now because it will allow them to make any policy changes they want uncontested. FUCKING VOTE FOR BIDEN. We all know it\u2019s a sucky choice! We all know we hate the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d game! I supported Bernie Sanders for 8 years and I still grit my teeth and voted for Hillary! What happened? Trump packed the supreme Court, got Roe turned over, they increased legal discrimination by religious people against minorities, and they\u2019re letting trump run roughshod over our justice system. This isn\u2019t just a president. This is an entire goddamn government and you need to get your fucking ass out, registered to vote, and vote EARLY, for your entire ballot. State Senate, state House, state judiciary, vote for someone for the local fucking dog catcher and mining inspector. This is so fucking important. I\u2019m mad about Gaza too, I\u2019ve written to my representatives about it, but I\u2019m voting for Biden, because this is what we have to do. Does anyone remember Reagan\u2019s 1980 plot to put disabled children in institutions rather than public education? It never passed, because Joe Biden teamed up with my husband\u2019s mother and hundreds of mothers of disabled kids to help defeat it. He might be unwanted but he\u2019s our only choice right now.  I spent like 3 seconds scrolling through the Tumblr of the revolutionary cosplayer up there, and honestly, it\u2019s really, really depressing watching someone in their early 20s rage about how \u201cyou\u2019re not making REAL CHANGE in your community, none of these things are REAL CHANGE, I\u2019m not talking about just changing the color of the boot on my neck\u201d like girl I genuinely love the energy but nothing is more exhausting and pointless than someone who refuses to acknowledge the real and actual change being made just because it isn\u2019t wearing the correct leftist hat or because it came from someone that you don\u2019t think is radical enough. I genuinely hope she keeps her determination to do something meaningful and turns it from just saying \u201cwhat you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t cool enough so you suck\u201d into \u201chow can we actually do shit together\u201d. I get it. You have to go through a period like that when you first get radicalized. But like.  Get the fuck over yourself. Let\u2019s get some shit done.  i am too old and have seen too much to have Any patience for punk-ass kids who mistake nihilism for activism. fucking grow up, hold your nose, and vote for the person who will at least staunch some of the bleeding. we can\u2019t make progress if we\u2019re dead.",

        "summary": "\u00a0Campaigns She had diverse health policy interests in SenateVice President Kamala Harris addresses an event with descendants of iconic civil rights leaders to celebrate Black History Month at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on February 13. (Tom Wiliams/CQ Roll Call)By\u00a0Jessie Hellmann\u00a0and\u00a0Ariel CohenPosted July 25, 2024 at 7:00amExpected Democratic presidential nominee\u00a0Kamala Harris has been an outspoken\u00a0proponent of abortion access and maternal health during her time in Washington, but her Senate record demonstrates a wide range of health policy passions, from telemedicine to enforcing consumer protection laws. \u201cI spent my entire career fighting to protect consumers and lower medical bills for families,\u201d the vice president\u00a0said in a call with reporters last month, citing protecting the 2010 health care law and blocking health care industry mergers as among her greatest health care accomplishments.\u00a0\u00a0 Harris, a former California attorney general who represented her state in the Senate from 2017 to 2021 before becoming vice president, is likely to carry the Biden administration\u2019s mantle forward in her presidential campaign, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF.\u00a0 \u201cI would expect Harris to largely continue the health care agenda set out by Biden, with greater emphasis on abortion rights and issues she has taken the lead on, such as medical debt,\u201d he said in an email.\u00a0 But her prior experience is instructive: In the Senate, Harris spent much of her time focusing on mental health, telemedicine and drug pricing. Harris was an early proponent of telehealth\u00a0\u2014 even before the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Senate, she introduced legislation that would make it easier for Medicare beneficiaries to receive mental health telehealth services and to help mental health professionals repay their student loans faster. Although neither of those bills advanced out of committee, Congress has eliminated restrictions on telehealth coverage through the end of 2024, and lawmakers are considering making the changes permanent.\u00a0\u00a0 Harris also led Senate efforts to curb racism among health care workers and reduce racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. She introduced two bills to increase non-bias training for health care providers during the pandemic and track race and ethnicity data when it came to COVID-19. She focused much of her Senate health policy work on maternal health \u2014\u00a0especially Black maternal health, as Black women are two to three times more likely to die of pregnancy complications than white women, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During her time in the Senate, she introduced several bills aimed at curbing the maternal mortality crisis in the United States, most notably as a co-sponsor of the \u201cmomnibus\u201d\u00a0measure,\u00a0a package of 13 bills aimed at improving maternal health, with a focus on Black women. Several of the package\u2019s provisions, including grant programs for training and research, were later included in President Joe Biden\u2019s domestic policy package passed by the House in 2021, but the \u201cmomnibus\u201d provisions were omitted from the final law. In 2022, as vice president, Harris announced a nationwide\u00a0Blueprint\u00a0for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis. She played a key role in the Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0push\u00a0for states to expand\u00a0Medicaid postpartum coverage from two to 12 months, creating \u201cbirthing friendly\u201d hospital designations and launching the maternal mental health hotline (1-833-TLC-MAMA). When she ran for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, Harris co-sponsored Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill before introducing her own version that included private insurance. The walk-back was met with criticism from progressive voters. Health care costs\u00a0As a prosecutor, Harris was responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws, often challenging decisions made by health care providers and companies that she felt jeopardized those protections.\u00a0 \u201cShe has been focused on how to improve the heath care system so it actually works for people, not just in theory but in practice,\u201d said Jill Habig, who oversaw Harris\u2019 health care portfolio while she was California\u2019s attorney general.\u00a0 As attorney general of California between 2011 and 2017, Harris investigated concentration in health care markets, laying the groundwork for her successor, Xavier Becerra, to challenge anticompetitive behavior by Sutter Health, one of the largest hospital systems in California, according to a 2020 Health Affairs\u00a0article. She joined other states and the Department of Justice in a lawsuit to block the proposed merger of Anthem and Cigna, two large health insurance companies, and scrutinized practices used by drug companies to extend the market exclusivity of their products.\u00a0 If Harris were to become president, she would do so during a time when health care is even more consolidated and drug companies continue to maintain exclusivity on many pricey, brand-name drugs.\u00a0 The Biden administration has made some moves in those areas, with the Federal Trade Commission investigating pharmacy benefit managers and consolidation in the health care industry. But a Harris administration could become more aggressive, Habig said.\u00a0 \u201cAs a career prosecutor, she\u2019s going to lean into the accountability piece: How do we make sure when setting standards for companies that there is actual accountability to follow through on those commitments so people can get what they expect from insurance companies, health care providers and drug companies,\u201d she said. Medical debt\u00a0The Biden administration became the first to try to address the issue of medical debt. About 15 million Americans have $49 billion worth of medical debt in collections listed on their credit reports, according to\u00a0data released\u00a0in April by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It has become one of Harris\u2019 issues, with the vice president announcing in June a proposed rule that would bar credit reporting agencies from including medical debt on credit reports sent to lenders. The intent is to ensure that medical debt\u00a0information is not used to make credit eligibility determinations.\u00a0 \u201cWe are making it so that medical debt cannot be used against you when you apply for a car loan, a home loan or small-business loan, or something of that nature,\u201d Harris said in a call with reporters.\u00a0 AbortionAbortion access is one of the top policy issues in Harris\u2019 vice presidential portfolio, which Democrats view as a key electoral issue this year.\u00a0 Unlike Biden, a practicing Catholic who tries to keep reproductive rights as a main-stage policy issue but has said that \u201che is not big on abortion,\u201d Harris was the first vice president to visit a Planned Parenthood clinic. She spent much of her time in office crisscrossing the country to talk about reproductive rights. Harris has gone further than Biden when it comes to abortion rights and proposed protections that would go beyond restoring the Roe v. Wade standard by limiting state restrictions.\u00a0Her proposal, which she floated in 2019 while serving in the Senate, would require states with a history of limiting abortion access to get clearance from the Department of Justice. Her candidacy has already mobilized anti-abortion groups. SBA Pro Life America has dubbed her an \u201cabortion czar\u201d and criticized her policy views. \u201cWhile Joe Biden has trouble saying the word abortion, Kamala Harris shouts it,\u201d SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser\u00a0said. Abortion rights groups are already formally endorsing Harris. They include Reproductive Freedom for All and EMILY\u2019s List, a group that backs candidates who support abortion access. \u00a0 In one of her first stops on the presidential campaign trail on Wednesday, Harris vowed to sign any legislation Congress might pass to restore federal abortion protections. \u201cWe are not playing around,\u201d she told an audience in Indianapolis. https://rollcall.com/",

        "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Norman Johnson and Carl Ericsson attended the same high school at the same time in Madison, South Dakota, a farm town of 6,500. That's all they had in common. Johnson, a member of the class of 1958, had been a popular football star while Ericsson, in the class ahead of him, was a loner and the team's water boy. As high school students, and as adults, these men lived vastly contrasting lives. Norman Johnson married his high school girlfriend and became a pillar of the local community while Ericsson moved away, married and lived in comparative obscurity. \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After college Norman Johnson returned to Madison where, for the next 35-years, he taught high school English and coached the football team. In retirement he remained active in the community as a playground supervisor, proofreader for the hometown newspaper and as a part time employee at the local hardware store. He was still married to his high school girlfriend, had two grown daughters and lived in a modest two-story house in town. He was surrounded by former students who still called him Mr. Johnson. \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After high school Carl Ericsson moved to Wyoming where he found a low-level job with the federal government. After retirement he moved to Watertown, South Dakota 50 miles north of Madison. As an alcoholic who was chronically depressed, Mr. Ericsson was a surely, difficult man who loved his dog more than people. He lived in a tiny one-story house with his long-suffering wife. As is the custom with profoundly unhappy maladjusted people he did not get along with his father, a successful attorney in Madison, or his younger brother Dick who had followed their father into the law. He also complained and harassed the children in his neighborhood, gave people who irritated him the finger and once even threatened to kill his younger brother. He was the type of person psychologists, psychiatrists and medication can't fix. People avoided him like the plague. \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On the evening of January 31, 2011 Carl Ericsson was seen in Madison prowling around backyards, knocking on residents' doors and shinning his flashlight into homes. As further evidence he was up to no good he was in possession of a Glock 45-caliber pistol with a 17-round clip, one of many handguns he owned. \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At 7:30 that evening Carl Ericsson pulled his brown Ford Taurus up to Norman Johnson's house, walked up the sidewalk and knocked on his front door. When Mr. Johnson appeared at the entrance he did not recognize the man standing on his stoop with the shock of white hair and full beard. The men hadn't seen each other since high school. \"Are you Norman Johnson?\" Ericsson asked. Immediately after Johnson answered yes the former water boy shot the retired teacher in the face--twice--leaving him to die in the doorway of his home.",

        "summary": "Erectile dysfunction is a common condition that affects millions of men worldwide.\u00a0 Defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance, ED can significantly impact a man's quality of life, self-esteem, and intimate relationships.\u00a0  Fortunately, there are effective treatment options available, one of which is Sildigra 250mg.\u00a0  This article aims to explain how Sildigra 250mg works, its benefits, and how it can help men overcome the challenges of erectile dysfunction in men. Erectile DysfunctionErectile dysfunction is characterized by the persistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection that is firm enough for sexual intercourse.\u00a0  This condition can be occasional or chronic, affecting men of all ages but becoming more prevalent with increasing age.  Causes of EDED can result from various factors, which can be broadly categorized into physical, psychological, and lifestyle-related causes: Physical Causes: These include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, hormonal imbalances, and neurological disorders. Poor blood flow to the penis due to atherosclerosis (blocked arteries) is a common physical cause. Psychological Causes: Mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, depression, and relationship problems can also contribute to ED. Performance anxiety and past sexual trauma can interfere with the ability to achieve an erection. Lifestyle Factors: Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet, and lack of physical activity can contribute to ED. These factors can affect overall health and sexual function. Symptoms of EDThe primary symptom of ED is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection firm enough for sexual activity.\u00a0  This can lead to frustration, anxiety, and reduced sexual satisfaction. Additionally, ED can strain relationships and impact emotional and psychological health. What is Sildigra 250mg?Sildigra 250mg is a medication specifically designed to treat erectile dysfunction. The active ingredient in Sildigra is Sildenafil citrate, which is also used in other well-known ED medications like Viagra. Sildigra is available in various strengths, with 250mg being one of the higher dosages.

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

        "summary": "3 Benefits of Microdosing Psychedelics\nWhile research is limited, here are three of the main potential health benefits of psychedelic microdoses. \n1. May Lead to a Short-Term Mood Boost\nLSD acts on the same serotonin neurotransmitter system as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are common antidepressant medications. This is why the scientific community, theoretically, believe that LSD taken as a hallucinogenic dose or microdose may be beneficial in mood disorders, De Wit explains. \nIn one study, people who did not have depression were given either a placebo, 13 micrograms (mcg) of LSD, or 26 mcg of LSD every three to four days (these were considered microdoses for this study\u2019s purposes). They were then monitored on their mood, cognitive performance, and responses to emotional tasks. The 26 mcg dose produced \u201cfeeling a drug effect\u201d and stimulant effects when the drug was taken, but it did not change mood or cognition over the four-week course of the study. \n[4] \n\nResults were admittedly a little disappointing to the researchers. \u201cWe were hoping to see a decrease in depression or anxiety scores, or more feelings of well-being. But the benefits were mixed and minimal,\u201d says De Wit. \u201cEach direct dose produces some feelings of well-being and energy, but over time that declines a bit, and you feel those effects less and less with each dose.\u201d In the end, De Wit and her research colleagues could not find real improvements in feelings of well-being or behavior different from a placebo. \nAnother randomized trial of healthy male adults similarly had participants take either LSD or a placebo. The LSD group took 14 doses of 10 mcg of LSD every three days over six weeks. Ten percent of the LSD group dropped out because of treatment-related anxiety. Over the course of the study, daily questionnaires showed that people felt more creative, connected, energetic, and happy, as well as less irritable. They also experienced greater well-being on the days they were given the drug. But these benefits were short-lived.",

        "summary": "Cultivating a good lifestyle is more important than ever in today\u2019s fast-paced world. The stresses of everyday life can cause stress, anxiety, and other mental health disorders. If these conditions are not treated, they can worsen and result in addiction. These 15 techniques will assist you in living a happier and more satisfying life. \nPractice Gratitude \n \nGratitude is fundamental to staying positive throughout the day. When we spend even a moment throughout the day to show acknowledgment towards things we have in our lives, it can automatically shift our focus from our insecurities to self-confidence and help foster a sense of appreciation and abundance for the present moment. Through a thankful mindset, you will discover that depression, anxiety, and sadness are diminished. \nJust Focus on Positive Affirmations \n \nYou must have to shift your brain from a negative to a positive mindset if you want to find long-term happiness. Your daily life mantra should be to spend 2-3 minutes three times a day thinking about the positive things, people, or past you had in your life. Repeat affirmations like, \u201cI\u2019m resilient\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m capable\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m worthy\u201d. Adopt this habit for 45 days; the brain will automatically start doing this and will help you to reduce negative thinking and boost self-esteem. \nPractice Mindfulness \n \nMeditation and mindfulness are powerful tools to reduce stress and increase mind clarity as they work by bringing your attention and awareness to the present moment, so you can let go of worries about the past and future. It\u2019s all about being non judgemental and accepting of your current feelings.",

When something has taken so much from us in order to be achieved, the idea of letting it go or changing direction isn\u2019t a straightforward or even appealing one. But, sometimes, this mindset can become a trap, holding us back from better and more fulfilling things. \nThe \u2018sunk cost fallacy\u2019 is a cognitive bias that centres on the feeling that you should continue putting your energy into a situation because you have already \u2018sunk\u2019 so much into it so far.

This can range from relatively small things \u2013 such as finishing reading a book that we\u2019re not enjoying, simply because we have started it \u2013 all the way up to some of life\u2019s biggest choices, including remaining in unhappy long-term relationships, pursuing education we feel no passion for, sticking to a career track that no longer fulfils us, and any number of other scenarios where a fear of the \u2018sunk cost\u2019 feels greater than what would be gained should you change direction. \nIt\u2019s an experience that has been well-researched, with one study, published in The Journal of Personality finding a positive correlation between anxiety and the sunk cost fallacy and a negative correlation between depression and committing the fallacy. Considering why this might be, the study authors believe that those who live with depression are more likely to see their environment as something that is out of their control and also have been shown to underestimate their chances of success compared to those who are not depressed, and so tend to avoid being drawn in by the positive expectation of the future, which is at the core of this cognitive trap. \nOther studies have found links between anger, stress, cooperation, fear, and even age as a factor in how this fallacy plays out. But it\u2019s also something that we can recognise in our culture. The idea of perseverance, or dedication, and commitment are all highly heralded qualities \u2013 particularly when considering positive traits in the workplace, but also in other examples. Long-term relationships are often judged favourably on the fact of their length alone, without always investigating the day-to-day experience. And the same can be said for other types of relationships, such as friendships we made early in life, but that may no longer serve us as we have grown and changed with time. \nThe reason that this fallacy is both so alluring and so potentially damaging, is that it presents perseverance as the correct decision, even in cases when there may be more to gain by cutting your losses and changing direction. It can hold you back in both big and small ways \u2013 and so if this is a trap you often find yourself in, perhaps it\u2019s time to break free. \nA study, published in Psychological Science, found that the sunk cost fallacy could be reduced by soothing negative mindsets through tools such as mindfulness and meditation \u2013 which makes sense. Becoming aware of this limiting mindset is something that will shine an awful lot of light on it, and will allow you to take a step back and really assess the situation. \nYou may want to make this assessment by writing down some notes. In some cases, a pros and cons list will go a long way, in other cases you may wish to dig a little deeper into what it is that has led you to believe that you have invested too much into something to let it go. When you take a step back, to take a clear and considered look at the words on the page in front of you, things may suddenly fall into place and you could walk away with a fresh new perspective. \nIn other cases, you may wish to work through your experiences with a mental health professional such as a counsellor or life coach. Sometimes, the attitudes and beliefs that we hold onto and have been built up over a lifetime can be tricky to untangle, but with support and guidance progress is possible.",

Visitors will store items in the locker while spending time at the site. The cooling station will be open from noon to 5 p.m. and will provide guests with a bag lunch as well as a place to get out of the heat. \nBy Donna Thompson \nThe Loaves and Fishes Warming Center offered people without housing a place to spend their nights this past winter. \nBut just as shelter during cold weather is vital, so is having a place cool to get a break from summer\u2019s heat and humidity. A new cooling station in Ilion, also operated by Loaves and Fishes, offers just that. \nThe cooling station opened Monday, July 22, at 55 Central Plaza in Ilion. The entrance is from the West Street side door only; just look for the sign on the door. \nAccording to Christine Lawrence, who manages Loaves and Fishes, the plan is to have the station open from noon to 5 p.m. seven days a week. Coffee, water, and a bag lunch will be provided. If a seven-day-a-week schedule cannot be maintained, it would be cut back to Thursday through Monday since food programs are not available on the weekends. \nThe center has an intake area, where visitors will be required to sign the guest rules each time they come and will be assigned a locker to store their personal belongings, she said. A common area will provide space for people to eat, chat, play games, do crafts or puzzles or just relax. A staff member will provide access to the restroom as needed. \nThe idea for a cooling station came up after the warming center at the Salvation Army in Herkimer closed for the season at the end of April. Lawrence discussed it with the Loaves and Fishes staff and they were open to the plan. \n\u201cJust as we don\u2019t want to lose someone to minus 10-degree temperatures, we don\u2019t want to lose someone when the temperature is over 100 degrees,\u201d she said. \n\u00a0It has taken time to locate a space for the project and obtain the necessary approvals.",

Whether you are fighting depression, anxiety, or any other illness, combined with treatment under the care of a health professional, fitness can help lead the way to success. Here are some tips to get you moving and to improve your mental health. \nAll you need is a good pair of shoes and preferably a music device! \n1) Walking \u2013 A simple stroll around the block can be a great way to improve your mood. Dare to step off the treadmill and into the great outdoors. It will help you get a bit of Vitamin D with your exercise. This is a great way to improve your heart health and to give you chance to calm your mind and think through your thoughts. \nTry to aim for walking 30 minutes a day, and listen to some music or an audio book to pass the time. \n2) Stretching \u2013 A regular yoga practice or even just a few stretches at your desk during work can help improve blood flow and keep your brain in check. You can check out a free yoga class on youtube.com, or you can just pick up a few stretches from any \u201cworkout on an airplane\u201d routine that you can do at your desk. \n3) Running \u2013 Even if you have never run before, running is a great way to calm an anxious mind. You can start out with a Couch to 5K, and then aim for a local 5 or 10K run. Run for 30 minutes a few times a week to help boost your overall health as well as your mental health. \nYou can track your progress with a running app, and compete against yourself. You may find you love it and end up running a marathon in a few years time. \n4) Dancing \u2013 You don\u2019t need to be a great dancer. Just turn on some of your favorite music, close your blinds, and dance around your room. Or if you have a gaming system, try a round of Dance Dance Revolution or Just Dance.

        "url": "https://www.eatmy.news/2024/07/nidhi-mohan-kamal-through-tailored.html",
        "summary": "This extreme intervention not only yielded remarkable results but also strengthened our relationship, highlighting the importance of a supportive and committed approach to wellness.  1. Tell us about your background and journey. My background is rooted in a blend of science and fitness. I hold a degree in Food and Chemical Engineering, which laid the foundation for my understanding of nutrition and metabolism. My journey into wellness began with my passion for fitness and health, which eventually led me to co-found Nidsun Wellness.\u00a0 Over the years, I have trained as a nutritionist, strength coach, and yoga instructor, which has allowed me to create a holistic approach to health and wellness. I have taken a 2-year break from expanding my company to focus on my MBA at the Sauder School of Business. I plan to reinvent the brand and make it bigger in the future. 2. Can you share your journey into the world of wellness and what inspired you to co-found Nidsun Wellness? My journey into wellness was sparked by my own transformation. I struggled with weight issues and unhealthy eating habits, which affected my overall well-being. Through disciplined nutrition and fitness routines, I transformed my body and mind. This personal journey inspired me to help others achieve similar results, leading to the co-founding of Nidsun Wellness.\u00a0 Additionally, my past work in the food and healthcare industries, where I didn't resonate with the ethos, motivated me to create a company that truly prioritizes holistic health and wellness. Our mission is to provide personalized wellness solutions that cater to the unique needs of each individual. 3. What does a typical day in your life look like, balancing roles as a nutritionist, strength coach, and yoga instructor? A typical day in my life starts early with a yoga session to center myself. I then move on to client consultations where I provide nutritional guidance and strength training plans. Each day is different; some days are dedicated to developing content for my wellness programs and engaging with my social media audience in the afternoons, while other days involve attending classes and working on assignments for my MBA at Sauder School of Business.\u00a0 I am also working full-time with the Rogers-UBC partnership, which adds another layer of responsibility to my daily routine. Evenings often involve teaching yoga classes or conducting workshops. Balancing these roles requires a structured schedule and a commitment to self-care. 4.How would you describe your nutrition philosophy, and what are the core principles you advocate for your clients? My nutrition philosophy is rooted in balance and sustainability. I advocate for a plant-based diet rich in whole foods, emphasizing the importance of unprocessed, nutrient-dense foods.\u00a0 Core principles include mindful eating, hydration, and the incorporation of a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. I believe in creating personalized nutrition plans that are realistic and can be maintained long-term. 5. What are some current fitness trends that you believe are beneficial and which ones do you think people should be cautious about? Beneficial trends include functional fitness, which focuses on movements that improve daily life activities, and mindfulness practices like yoga and meditation. However, I advise caution with extreme diets and workout regimes that promise quick fixes. Trends like high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can be effective but should be approached with proper guidance to avoid injury.\u00a0 Another emerging trend is the use of Ozempic, a medication originally designed for type 2 diabetes management, which is now being explored for weight loss. While Ozempic could change the game for weight management, it is crucial to be cautious about who uses it and the dosage administered. It's important to consult healthcare professionals to ensure it is used safely and effectively, as misuse or overuse can lead to significant side effects. 6. As a yoga E-RYT 500, how do you integrate the principles of yoga into your nutrition and strength training programs? Yoga principles are deeply integrated into my nutrition and strength training programs through the emphasis on mindfulness, breath control, and balance. Yoga teaches body awareness, which is crucial for safe and effective strength training. Additionally, the mindfulness aspect of yoga helps clients develop a healthier relationship with food, promoting mindful eating habits.\u00a0 Yoga is how I live, how I interact, and how I approach my work. My dedication to my work is rooted in yoga, and it translates into everything in my life, including my relationships. This holistic approach ensures that the principles of yoga are not just confined to the mat but permeate all aspects of my personal and professional life. 7. What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced in your career and how have they shaped your approach to wellness? One of the biggest challenges has been overcoming misinformation in the wellness industry. This has shaped my approach to prioritize evidence-based practices and continuous education. Another challenge is helping clients maintain motivation and consistency.\u00a0 This has taught me the importance of personalized coaching and the need to address both physical and mental aspects of health. Additionally, balancing the expansion of Nidsun Wellness with my MBA studies has tested my time management and prioritization skills, reinforcing the importance of self-discipline and resilience. 8. Can you share a memorable success story from one of your clients that has stuck with you? One memorable success story is of a client who struggled with severe obesity and related health issues. Through a tailored nutrition and fitness plan, combined with consistent support and motivation, she lost over 50 pounds and significantly improved her health markers. Her journey was transformative not just physically but also mentally, as she developed a positive relationship with her body and food.\u00a0 I have personally raided her kitchen, throwing out tons of unhealthy food and replacing it with nutritious groceries. This extreme intervention not only yielded remarkable results but also strengthened our relationship, highlighting the importance of a supportive and committed approach to wellness. 9. What are your top three tips for someone looking to start their journey towards a healthier lifestyle? Start Small: Begin with small, manageable changes rather than overhauling your entire lifestyle at once. Stay Consistent: Consistency is key to long-term success. Create a routine that you can stick to. Seek Support: Surround yourself with a supportive community or seek professional guidance to stay motivated and accountable. 10. How has your experience living and working in Vancouver influenced your approach to wellness compared to your time in India? Living in Vancouver has exposed me to a diverse range of wellness practices and a strong emphasis on outdoor activities. This has influenced my approach by incorporating more outdoor workouts and nature-based activities into my programs.\u00a0 Compared to India, where traditional practices like yoga are more prevalent, Vancouver has offered a blend of modern and traditional wellness techniques, enriching my holistic approach. 11. What are your future goals for Nidsun Wellness, and what new projects or initiatives are you excited about? My future goals for Nidsun Wellness include expanding our reach through online platforms and developing comprehensive wellness programs that cater to a global audience. I'm excited about upcoming projects that involve integrating technology with wellness, such as virtual fitness classes and personalized nutrition apps. These initiatives aim to make wellness accessible and convenient for everyone, regardless of location.\u00a0 However, I am currently decompressing and focusing on my MBA at the Sauder School of Business. This period of focus and growth will ensure that the new changes come from a better and more business-acumen-equipped Nidhi, ready to take the brand to new heights and meet the evolving needs of our clients.

        "url": "https://ed-treatment-and-cure.blogspot.com/2024/07/the-vicious-cycle-anxiety-stress-and.html",
        "summary": "Erectile dysfunction affects millions of men worldwide. It is frequently discussed in terms of physical health difficulties, but the psychological impact is an important consideration that is not generally given adequate emphasis. Anxiety and stress, in particular, have an important influence in the development and progression of erectile dysfunction. Understanding this vicious cycle might help you identify successful solutions and break free from it. The Interplay of Anxiety and Stress with Erectile DysfunctionWhen you have erectile dysfunction, it is more than simply a physical issue. The psychological impact can be severe, causing increased anxiety and stress, which can worsen the disease. This generates a feedback loop in which worry and stress both contribute to and worsen erectile dysfunction. How Anxiety and Stress Contribute to Erectile Dysfunction: Anxiety is a frequent emotional response to a variety of life events, and it can have a major impact on sexual function. An erection might be difficult to get or maintain when you are concerned about your performance, afraid of failure, or under pressure to meet expectations. In contrast, stress can have a wide range of effects on the body. It can cause physical symptoms such as weariness, muscle strain, and hormonal abnormalities, which can all contribute to erectile dysfunction. Stress activates the body's fight-or-flight response, which causes the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can constrict blood vessels, decrease blood flow, and impair sexual performance. Chronic stress can eventually cause long-term problems with erectile function. The Psychological Toll of Erectile Dysfunction: Erectile dysfunction has a profound psychological impact, in addition to its physical consequences. Men with erectile dysfunction frequently face feelings of embarrassment, inadequacy, and frustration. These feelings might contribute to a cycle of anxiety and tension. The dread of not being able to perform might cause performance anxiety, which can exacerbate the problem. This psychological weight can be overpowering, making it much more difficult to treat the physical components of erectile dysfunction. The loop of anxiety and stress might discourage men from seeking assistance and discovering effective therapies. Breaking the Cycle: Treatment OptionsAddressing the psychological components of erectile dysfunction is crucial for effective treatment. Fortunately, there are several strategies and treatments available that can help break this vicious cycle. Therapy and Counseling: The psychological aspects of erectile dysfunction can be addressed most effectively through therapy and counseling. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and sex therapy can help people manage anxiety, stress, and boost their self-esteem. Working with a therapist can help you cope with the emotional effects of erectile dysfunction while also improving your overall sexual health. Medication: Medication can often be an effective component of an erectile dysfunction therapy approach. Drugs such as Kamagra Gold 100 might be prescribed to alleviate the physical symptoms of erectile dysfunction. It contains sildenafil, a drug that works by increasing blood flow to the penis, allowing you to develop and sustain an erection. If you're thinking about taking Kamagra Gold 100 or other comparable pills, you should talk to your doctor first to make sure they're right for you. You might look into buying Kamagra Gold 100 online, but make sure you're buying from a reliable source. Lifestyle Changes: Making healthy lifestyle changes can improve both physical and mental health. Regular exercise, a well-balanced diet, and enough sleep can help reduce stress and enhance overall health. Additionally, using relaxation practices such as meditation or yoga might help manage anxiety. Open Communication: Many men find that openly discussing their erectile dysfunction with a spouse can be quite relieving. Effective communication can lessen feelings of isolation and give emotional support, alleviating some of the worry and stress associated with the disease. Moving ForwardErectile dysfunction is a multifaceted issue that includes both physical and psychological components. Understanding how anxiety and stress contribute to erectile dysfunction can aid in the development of a thorough treatment plan. Individuals who address both the mental and physical parts of the disease may break away from the vicious cycle and enhance their quality of life.  If you have erectile dysfunction, you should get advice from a healthcare specialist who can walk you through the numerous treatment choices available. There are strategies to manage and overcome the obstacles of erectile dysfunction, including treatment, medication such as Kamagra Gold 100, and lifestyle changes. Remember that seeking treatment is the first step toward restoring your health and well-being.",

You don't want to walk this path, but it's the only route available, and as such, you must; and your disappointment at being on this path makes you look at the ground instead of the sky. We yearn for connection. We yearn for the power to resolve our own problems and to be the masters of our own story, and at every turn we are corseted by societal restraint, daily tedium, and barely 10-20% of the volume of information and stimulation that media forms will give us. And when our brains cannot work out the difference between adoring real life characters and scenarios, and adoring fictional characters and scenarios, it goes for the bigger meal; why have 10-20% when you could have 100%? Even worse! Your feet ache and your heart aches, and new paths appear, leading you to fandom and other people who are enjoying this journey as much as you. You can't resist, a glutton for more; why have 100% when you can have 120%? And people aren't writing fanfiction about real life. If they do, it's fiction, and while it's juicy it's still not as satisfying as fantasy, which offers so much more. This holds hands with your voltage theory, I think. Again, I say this as a neuromild instead of a neurospicy, but I am guilty of this too. I do often feel greater intensity of emotion for fictional scenarios because they are designed to be that way. When you have a vivid imagination, and are intelligent, as clearly you are, that stimulation sends fireworks through you. You are absolutely alight, every nerve stimulated, and the emotion just fizzlepopping through you.  I don't believe you're 'abnormal', but it is always good to self-reflect. Are fictional scenarios and media forms reducing your ability to enjoy/feel things for real people and daily life, or do you enjoy/feel things for real people and daily life as much as you always did? Think carefully now. The relative hugeness of the things you feel for fictional scenarios may, at first, convince you that it's the former, and convince you that you're slowly becoming numb to life. If you work out that it's the latter, and you are not becoming numb to life, then this sounds like a healthy, if extreme, response to media forms. If you're gradually becoming more numb, we need to address the root issues, mental health worries or life/social dissatisfaction or need to escape something pathologically unaddressed, often being the answer. I often feel different. I often feel like I connect to emotion harder and more viscerally than the people around me. I am a social chameleon, and exceptionally good at being whatever a social situation wants me to be. @mrhaitch understands what lies underneath, and gets to experience me as I am at base. I often spend so much time being another version of myself, that I forget who I am, and have to come back to myself. I tend to suppress or limit my involvement, because I like taking the overview, allowing my feelings and opinions to develop as new information comes to light. I am self-possessed over my own opinions and their ability to grow and change, and as such, don't feel pressurised to feel a certain way. I don't feel the need to engage in fandom rhetoric, and actually, I strongly dislike engaging with it; this is as close as I'll get. Being a 'creator' suits me well. I almost never discuss my thoughts and feelings about series' etc aloud, in comments or real life. I'd discuss it, if prompted, but I certainly don't seek it out.  There is also the core part of me that needs/wants to maintain a certain image in real life, and as such, most people don't know that I'm even into anime. The barest couple of people, I can count on one hand, know that I even write. I'm fine with this; I am perfectly happy to conceal parts of myself, that belong to me alone, with my long-suffering husband as a privileged/punished bystander. I think extreme emotional connection to media forms can show good empathy. I would overall be more concerned about someone who does not show deep emotional responses to media forms that are designed to make them feel this way. I believe that progressive societal numbing to emotion is routinely seen in daily life, and begins in childhood; how many of us recall being told that our emotional reactions are abnormal, irregular, over the top or embarrassing? We learn to suppress, early on. This leaks out, and we suppress more and more as we grow, becoming number and number to the struggles of those around us. Progressive degradation of empathy is real, and we can and should resist. r.e. my writing, and me, though I viscerally hate to discuss my personality like this: I can acknowledge two traits I have; I am eloquent with a broad vocabulary, and I am very good at making other people feel how I want them to feel. This counts for real life and writing. This is good, and bad, and I try very hard not to be the Evil\u2122\ufe0f version of myself. I write with an aim, and I like critical hits. I'm a perfectionist and I always have been. I'm sorry to hurt you in this way. I usually use this socially (not consciously, it's just how I am) or at work, where I advocate for women and make sure they feel loved and safe. I'm quite good at it. Channelling this into creating stories for other people to enjoy has been an ability I didn't know I had until very recently. I agree that @rahuratna is a very rare talent. Arguably, I find her to be an exceptionally uncommon author. She would do very, very well to write a novel, if she ever felt it. Her writing skill is phenomenal. I only wish I had more time to read all of her work; I sadly find myself having to choose how to spend the very limited social time I have, and I often choose writing, as it relaxes me more than reading. But please know, rahuratna, I'm coming for you. Also know, @bunny584 is one of the rare ones, I'm my humble opinion. Perhaps that's why you like my writing? Just thoughts. Thanks for the amazing Inbox. I don't often get the time to do massive responses but I absolutely try my hardest. Good talk! Love, always, -- Haitch xxx",

The track masterfully blends beautiful strings with powerful, driving guitars to create a rich wall of sound, allowing the melodic vocals to shine. \u00a0 \u201cHeavy is one of my favourite songs on the album,\u201d says Chloe. \u201cLyrically, we took inspiration from the journeys of our fans and the push and pull anxiety can bring on within oneself. That crushing wave-like feeling is familiar to all of us.\u201d \u00a0 Lindsey adds, \u201cHeavy originally started out acoustically, with a much softer intro. As the idea for the song progressed and the lyrics became clearer, it felt natural to want to start the song with this complete wall of sound. Heavy has the most light and shade on the album. We wanted the song to reflect the way mental health can take over but with moments of clarity. The whole album has a thread of mental health issues, which is something that isn\u2019t spoken about enough. We want to help to change that.\u201d \u00a0 Billy notes, \u201cAnother element to the song is the beautiful string arrangement by the Vulcan String Quartet. The score adds so much movement and beauty against this huge backdrop.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 August 16th, Brave Rival will release their eagerly awaited sophomore album, \u201cFight or Flight,\u201d building on their debut with even greater intensity. Two of their singles, \u201cFive Years On\u201d and \u201cFairytale,\u201d both were voted as Classic Rock\u2019s Track Of The Week. \u00a0 \u00a0 Brave Rival will embark on an extensive tour this Autumn. With influences from the Wilson sisters of Heart to legends like Zeppelin and Fleetwood Mac, Brave Rival\u2019s musical lineage is undeniable.

While the common symptoms of dengue include high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, rash, and mild bleeding, the virus can also lead to much more serious neurological conditions as shared by Dr Pooja Anand, Associate consultant, Neurology, Paras Health, Gurugram. \nOne of the significant neurological complications of dengue is encephalitis, which is the inflammation of the brain. Encephalitis can cause severe headaches, confusion, paralysis of the body, seizures, and even coma. Meningitis, the inflammation of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord, can also occur, leading to symptoms like severe headaches and neck stiffness. Another critical condition is myelitis, which involves the inflammation of the spinal cord, potentially resulting in paralysis and other serious neurological symptoms. \nDengue encephalopathy is a particularly severe manifestation where the brain is directly affected by the virus or the body\u2019s immune response to it. Symptoms of dengue encephalopathy include changes in mental state, unusual behavior, and, in extreme cases, unconsciousness. Recognizing and treating this condition promptly is crucial to prevent long-term neurological damage. \nAdditionally, dengue can trigger Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves. This condition results in muscle weakness, paralysis, and potentially life-threatening breathing difficulties that require intensive care. The immune response to virus can trigger various secondary demyelinating disorders in brain. The dengue virus can directly infect the nervous system, causing inflammation and nerve damage. Furthermore, the immune response to the virus can lead to excessive inflammation and secondary demyelinating disorders in the brain, resulting in various neurological symptoms.",

I just wanted to jump in and help her. Twisty and gripping. I did love the cover. This author never fails me. This is my 11th book I\u2019ve read. I was shocked. That had my jaw on the floor. I did have a moment in the book when I thought no. It\u2019s not. It can\u2019t be.\u00a0 I did like the ending.\u00a0 5*.  Blurb. Has her husband really left her? Or is someone playing a deadly game?  When Eva\u2019s husband Samuel doesn\u2019t come home from a boys\u2019 night out, she thinks he\u2019s sleeping off his hangover at a friend\u2019s house. So she waits. And waits\u2026  Eventually, he sends her a text \u2013 he\u2019s met someone else and needs a few days to get his head together. Eva is devastated. How could he do this? How could he do it to their children? She\u2019d thought her marriage was rock solid.  She tries to go on with her life as best she can. But then things take a truly bizarre turn\u2026  She receives a terrifying photo of Samuel with a knife to his neck, and a demand: do everything on my bucket list or he will die.  As Eva completes the increasingly crazy demands on the kidnapper\u2019s bucket list, every aspect of her life begins to unravel: her children are struggling, she\u2019s not paying attention at work, and her friends and family fear for her mental health.

        "summary": "Dr Jill Nash writes for The Conversation about the dangers of being near water and the role emotions play in making safer decisions\u2026 \n\nMarBom/Shutterstock\nJill Nash, Bournemouth University \nJust being near blue spaces (the sea, rivers and lakes) can make us feel more relaxed because water triggers our parasympathetic nervous system, helping our body rest and digest. This calming effect, which slows our heart rate and lowers blood pressure, explains why so many people find joy and solace in water-related activities. \nBut enjoying the water also has serious risks that can\u2019t be ignored. In the UK, drowning is a leading cause of accidental deaths, surpassing even home fires and cycling accidents. Each year, around 400 people drown accidentally in the UK\u2019s coastal and inland waters. \nNotably, 40% of these incidents occur when people aren\u2019t even planning to be in the water, such as when they\u2019re caught off guard by a rising tide while walking along the coast or jumping in to rescue a dog. This is a glaring reminder that it isn\u2019t just traditional water users who get into danger. \nAccording to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, there are over 100,000 water rescues each year. These rescues are tragedies which leave lasting impact, with survivors (and their families) often suffering from severe injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder. \nIncident report data tells us that globally, men are 80% more likely to drown than women, especially middle-aged men and teenage boys. This higher risk is attributed to men spending more time in the water and engaging in riskier behaviours like swimming alone, at night, drinking alcohol, and neglecting life jackets. Social pressures and a tendency to underestimate risks (by assuming the water looks safe when it isn\u2019t) contribute to the higher drowning rates among men too. \nMy team of neuroscience and communication academics at Bournemouth University are working with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution to research how to improve water safety communications using virtual reality simulations to record brain activities when immersed in water.",

        "url": "https://thecelticstar.com/football-without-fans-brother-walfrid-east-london-csc/",
        "summary": "Brother Walfrid East London CSC Founded in August 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, when a few like-minded supporters used to gather in The Carpenter\u2019s Arms to watch the games. Their crowd was made up of former members of the Bhoys of Ilford CSC, which was founded in 2003 but sadly folded around 2011/12. Since the end of the Bhoys of Ilford, they often spoke about setting up a new club, but for now they were content to meet up and see each other for games in either the Queen\u2019s Head or Carpenter\u2019s Arms pubs in Stratford, East London. When COVID hit, a lot of people were lonely, struggling mentally, and not getting any social interaction, so it became more apparent that they needed something to bring them together and focus on. Chandra Connaghan started to think more seriously about trying to set up a new CSC, and with James (Cally) McAllister (RIP), they decided to get the ball rolling. Seamus and Pauline Clarke in The Carpenter\u2019s Arms had always been very welcoming to them, even though the bar was primarily a West Ham bar. She spoke with Seamus, and he welcomed the idea of a CSC being run from his bar with open arms.  So Cally and Chandra arranged a meeting a few weeks later with all those who had already shown an interest in a new club to come along and discuss the idea. On August 6, 2020, 15 people turned up and declared a new club. A few possible club names had been discussed over the following weeks, but it felt only right that they should be named Brother Walfrid, as not far from their Stratford HQ is St. Anne\u2019s Church and primary school, where Brother Walfrid resided and was Principal from 1893. This is also where the Celtic Foundation holds their London sleepouts, which they also proudly take part in every year. They immediately started the membership process and got their name out on social media, and membership started to increase. Sadly, Seamus passed away, but Pauline and their family have supported them fully to continue with their club.  They now have a solid team with a committee of six and 50+ members. They show every televised game unless West Ham are at home. Unfortunately, this is part of running a CSC in East London. They use these days as an opportunity to visit the other CSCs in London. It is not widely known, but they are like a big family and support each other\u2019s clubs, events, and fund-raising. Their charity work, amongst other things, includes the Celtic Foundation sleepout and 10k walk, the Jimmy Johnstone 6-a-side tournament for MND and prostate cancer, their weekly food drive at HQ for local foodbanks, as well as donations to other local homeless and mental health charities. They have produced merchandise including pin badges, keyrings, flags, polo tops, t-shirts, and regatta jackets. If you look very closely at their club badge and flag, there is a subtle nod to the Bhoys of Ilford-03. The year they were formed appears in the window of St. Mary\u2019s.  In January 2023, they were the first London club in almost 20 years to run a bus to Hampden, which was a great success, and there have been requests to run more, which they are looking into. In May 2022, Chandra, Paul Flynn of Hayes Bhoys CSC, and Jim McGarry of Ramsgate CSC set up the South CSCs events group and created a WhatsApp group for all willing CSCs in the South, which is currently 29 CSCs. This is a forum to share ideas, promote their events, and support each other. As part of this, Paul, Jim, and Chandra then organised the \u2018Brother Walfrid at Grove Ferry\u2019 event, with profits going to the Celtic Foundation. It was a great success and something they hope to do again. They are the newbies in London, and they only hope to get bigger and better for their members.

        "summary": "PinterestI once read somewhere that the worst prison in the world is a home without peace. I never understood the depth of that statement until I found myself living in\u00a0one. Every day feels like walking on eggshells. There\u2019s always a lingering tension in the air. The walls that should provide comfort and safety now feel like they\u2019re closing in, trapping me in a space that offers no\u00a0respite. The mornings start with silence, but not the peaceful kind. It\u2019s the quiet before a storm, a calm that makes you brace yourself for what\u2019s to come. Simple conversations turn into heated arguments, and every word is a potential trigger. The silence will then turn to screaming. Home is supposed to be a sanctuary, a place where you can be yourself without fear. But here, I feel like a stranger, always on guard, always pretending. I\u2019ve tried to escape in little ways. I lock myself in my room, plug in my earphones, and drown out the noise with music. I lose myself in books, in worlds where peace exists. But the real world always pulls me back, and the reality of my situation hits harder each\u00a0time. Friends ask why I don\u2019t hang out more often, why I don\u2019t invite them over. How do I explain that my home isn\u2019t a home? How do I tell them that I\u2019m too tired from fighting battles they can\u2019t see? It\u2019s easier to lie, to make up excuses, than to expose the\u00a0truth. \u201cNasan pamilya\u00a0mo?\u201d \u201cNandyan naman pero parang wala. Kumpleto naman pero hindi nagkakaisa.\u201d It\u2019s sad how family feels the farthest when they\u2019re supposed to be the\u00a0closest. Some nights, I lie in bed and dream of a different life. A life where home is a place of love and understanding, where disagreements are resolved with words, not war. A place where I can breathe freely, without the weight of unspoken grudges. I imagine a home filled with light and laughter, where coming home is a joy, not a source of anxiety. I dream of open, honest conversations, of hugs that heal instead of words that\u00a0hurt. There are moments when the weight of it all feels unbearable. I watch the clock, counting down the minutes until I can escape. School, work, even running errands\u200a\u2014\u200aanything to get away from the oppressive atmosphere that hangs over our house like a dark\u00a0cloud. I\u2019ve tried to talk about it, to voice how I feel, but my words are often met with indifference or defensiveness. \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting,\u201d they say. \u201cIt\u2019s just how families are.\u201d But I know that\u2019s not true. I\u2019ve seen families that thrive on love and support, where disagreements are just small bumps in the road, not mountains. It\u2019s the emotional scars that are the hardest to bear. Each argument leaves a mark, a reminder of the pain inflicted by those who are supposed to care the most. I\u2019ve learned to hide my feelings, to put on a brave face, but inside, the wounds fester. I find myself withdrawing, not wanting to share my pain with others, afraid they won\u2019t understand or worse, that they\u2019ll see me as\u00a0weak. On the worst days, I feel completely alone. Surrounded by people, yet isolated by the chasm of unspoken hurt and unresolved issues. I cling to the small moments of solace\u200a\u2014\u200aa kind word from a friend, one Sunday in church, the comfort of my favorite book, and my favorite song. These fleeting moments are my lifeline, my way of reminding myself that there is still good in the\u00a0world. Despite everything, I hold onto hope. Hope that one day, things will change. Maybe I\u2019ll find the courage to leave, to create a space of my own where peace reigns. Or maybe, just maybe, the people I live with will realize the damage being done and we\u2019ll find a way to mend our broken\u00a0bonds. Until then, I will keep dreaming of the day I\u2019ll finally be\u00a0free.",

I guess comparing the two is like comparing a surgeon and a physical therapist. The surgeon fixes the immediate issue, just like the psychiatrist does by giving you medication. The physical therapist is like the psychotherapist in that you are going to be going back in order to recover from the surgery and to learn how to work with your healing form.  (That analogy needs work but hopefully you see what I mean) Psychotherapists are less rigid because their services do not have anything to do with that legal / medical seriousness & admin, and they actially usually work UNDER a resident psychiatrist who oversees the therapy approaches like a CEO. they\u2019re focus is to make you feel comfortable, which isn\u2019t guaranteed when visiting a psychiatrist.  Thank you for this explanation, I remember asking my grief Therapist in HS would she give me a buncha meds and she said she wasn\u2019t going to allow it and that we\u2019d work together in sessions and with coping mechanism and unpacking my grief.  She prolly was just trying to steer me away. Shes a really one.  \u201cJust remember someone cares about you. But not me, not me ! I don\u2019t care\u2026 But somebody does.\u201d Wait this is\u2026.. not accurate? Therapists must have degrees, at least a masters, and a license\u2026. there are many different types of degrees and licenses with overlap in services and there are also lots of different modalities\u2026. but all require a degree and a license or at least supervision. A short list includes LICSW, LMHC, LMFT.  The main point is accurate, though, that therapists cannot prescribe medication unless they also have a medical degree or license to prescribe in some capacity. Psychiatrists and psychologists can prescribe.  Counselors and therapists are different.. and maybe some counselors don\u2019t need a higher degree/license, but if you are seeking mental health support from someone who is unlicensed or not credentialed you are in the wrong place. Please protect yourself and make sure you\u2019re getting support from a trained professional with real credentials.",

La stella del tennis italiana, nota per la sua straordinaria abilit\u00e0 e la rapida ascesa nello sport, ha intentato una causa contro il colosso dei media per aver diffuso informazioni false oltre a contestare apertamente queste accuse infondate. \n \nLe voci online sulla presunta morte di Sinner sono iniziate dopo che un media ESPN ha pubblicato un falso rapporto. Le false informazioni si sono diffuse rapidamente sui social media, incitando paura e ansia diffuse tra tennisti, spettatori e altri sportivi. Il falso rapporto affermava, in modo estremamente sconvolgente e non supportato, che Sinner era morto in circostanze strane. \nJannik Sinner ha smentito direttamente le notizie di morte sui social media. Sinner sembrava essere in buona salute ed \u00e8 stato visto in un video caricato sui suoi account Instagram e Twitter ufficiali.

Donate to Emergency: Help Evacuate My Family From GAZA WAR, organized by Ahmed Alshawish I\u2019ve witnessed the evidence of the tragedy that has struck our lives in Gaza, where my family and I have survived amidst numerous previous wars.\u00a0But today, we face the most dangerous and fierce battle in the current war. The urgent need intensifies for us, as we have nothing left and are unable to secure our basic needs such as food, water, and safe shelter. Here is our story - On October 7th, our lives changed forever, my family and I evacuated from northern Gaza to southern Gaza, hoping to return soon, but it wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u00a0Our home was surrounded, burned, and then completely destroyed, Our home, once a fortress of hope, now lay in ruins, a stark reminder of our shattered dreams. The night before we left from the north to the south was terrifying. Shelling sounds were everywhere, making a loud noise that felt like it went through our souls. Every\u00a0explosions shook the ground like earthquakes, sending shockwaves of fear through our trembling bodies. filling us with fear. The air smelled of destruction and blood, making it hard to breathe. When dawn came, we saw the devastation around us, realizing our home was now a symbol of loss and despair. We ran into the streets and with each step we took into the unknown streets, we felt as if we were plunging deeper into the abyss of our shattered existence, leaving behind everything we own in our home: Clothes, important official documents, the car, and literally it\u2019s almost everything - the enormity of our loss weighed heavily upon us. Our home it was where we found hope, safety, and made precious memories. Losing it felt like losing years of our lives, leaving us adrift amidst the wreckage of our shattered existence. A brief video depicting the devastation that struck our home and our entire neighborhood in Gaza. Desperate Plea: Escaping Gaza\u2019s Allergy Nightmare I, Haya, suffer from severe allergy to penicillin-derived medications, and my sister, Amal, also suffers from severe allergies to medications from my family such as Paracetamol and Ibuprofen. These allergies create a deep sense of fear and anxiety for us, as we live in a constant state of tension and fear of anything that may require a visit to the hospital.\u00a0We fear being given inappropriate medications due to the unavailability of suitable treatments in Gaza\u00a0because of war or lack of awareness and not informing the doctor of our allergies, which could lead to serious consequences threatening our lives. MY Father Income Our dreams are heading towards oblivion in the labyrinth of an uncertain future My story, along with my siblings, represents a united team of four individuals, three of whom are skilled programmers and one graphic designer. We work as freelancers in the world of freelancing. As for my younger sister, she is a student studying at the College of Architecture. She has always carried a big dream in her heart, a dream of being part of changing Gaza, of making it more beautiful and better.\u00a0She looked forward to the day when she would receive her degree and start building this dream.\u00a0But the beginning of the war changed everything. The destruction of infrastructure and universities cast shadows of despair over her dreams. When I think of my brother in Belgium, I can\u2019t help but feel deep sadness. He has been suffering from unbearable anxiety and insomnia since the outbreak of the war.\u00a0Sleep eludes him at night, and his physical and mental health collapses under the weight of these heavy burdens, negatively affecting his performance at work.\u00a0Problems and challenges pile up in front of him without the slightest opportunity for rest. We all feel psychological pressure and extreme anxiety. The war hasn\u2019t been limited to external attacks but has deeply infiltrated our daily lives.\u00a0We search among the rubble for a little safety and the basic resources for survival. Every day comes with a new challenge that we must overcome. As we sway amidst the rubble of shattered dreams, our souls wrestle and our hearts beat strongly challenging the ravages of war. Our parents earnestly seek a way to rescue us from this hell, feeling the heavy responsibility for every moment we spend under the shadows of fear and destruction. They dream of a safe place where they can build for us a better future, filled with security and hope, for\u00a0we deserve life in all its meanings of comfort and peace. Perhaps this fundraising campaign represents a light in the midst of darkness, it is indeed the only hope we cling to firmly. I appeal to the world as a whole to hear my cry and the mournful cry of my family in Gaza. We need the helping hand that reaches out to wipe our tears and build a bridge to safety. Your donation is not just a donation; it\u2019s an opportunity to rebuild life and brighten a better tomorrow. Be part of our hopeful story, for we need your hand to start anew.

        "url": "https://kellychang2713.blogspot.com/2024/07/what-were-main-points-of-zollikon.html",
        "summary": "The Zollikon Seminars, conducted by Martin Heidegger between 1959 and 1969 at the invitation of Swiss psychiatrist Medard Boss, represent a significant intersection of philosophy and psychiatry. The seminars took place in Zollikon, near Zurich, and involved discussions with psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and other professionals. The main points of these seminars can be summarized as follows:   1. **Phenomenological Approach to Psychiatry**: \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Critique of Scientific Reductionism**: Heidegger critiques the reductionist approach in psychiatry that views mental illness purely in terms of biological or chemical imbalances. He argues for a more holistic, phenomenological approach that considers the lived experience of patients. \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Daseinsanalysis**: Building on his concept of Dasein (being-there), Heidegger proposes Daseinsanalysis as a form of existential analysis that focuses on understanding patients' experiences within the context of their being-in-the-world.   2. **Understanding of Human Existence**: \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Being-in-the-World**: Heidegger emphasizes the concept of being-in-the-world, where individuals are always already situated in a context that includes relationships, culture, and environment. This contrasts with viewing the mind and body as separate entities. \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Temporal and Spatial Existence**: Heidegger highlights the temporal and spatial dimensions of human existence, suggesting that understanding a patient's experience requires considering their past, present, and future, as well as their spatial relationships with their environment.   3. **Therapeutic Relationship**: \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Authenticity and Being-with-Others**: Heidegger discusses the importance of authenticity and the therapeutic relationship. He suggests that therapists should engage with patients authentically, recognizing them as beings-with-others (Mitsein) and respecting their unique existence. \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Listening and Understanding**: Emphasis is placed on the need for therapists to truly listen and understand the patient's existential concerns, rather than merely diagnosing and treating symptoms.   4. **Health and Illness**: \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Existential Health**: Heidegger redefines health not simply as the absence of disease but as the ability to live authentically and fulfill one's potential within one's world. Illness, then, is understood as a disruption of this ability. \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Existential Analysis of Symptoms**: Symptoms of mental illness are seen as expressions of underlying existential issues. For instance, anxiety is interpreted not just as a clinical symptom but as an existential condition related to one's confrontation with the uncertainties of existence.   5. **Interdisciplinary Dialogue**: \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Collaboration with Psychiatry**: The seminars fostered a dialogue between philosophy and psychiatry, aiming to enrich psychiatric practice with phenomenological insights. Heidegger and Boss sought to bridge the gap between philosophical understanding and clinical practice. \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Influence on Psychotherapy**: The ideas discussed in the seminars influenced the development of existential psychotherapy and had a lasting impact on practitioners who attended the sessions.   6. **Critique of Technology**: \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Technology and Modern Medicine**: Heidegger critiques the technological orientation of modern medicine, which often treats patients as objects to be managed rather than as individuals with unique existential concerns. He advocates for a more human-centered approach that respects the patient's experience.   7. **Applications to Clinical Practice**: \u00a0 \u00a0 - **Case Studies and Practical Applications**: The seminars included discussions of specific case studies, where Heidegger and participants applied phenomenological concepts to understand and treat patients. These practical applications helped ground the philosophical ideas in real-world clinical practice.   In summary, the Zollikon Seminars represent Heidegger\u2019s effort to apply his existential and phenomenological philosophy to the field of psychiatry, advocating for a holistic understanding of human existence that goes beyond reductionist approaches. The main points include the emphasis on being-in-the-world, the importance of authenticity in therapeutic relationships, a redefined concept of health and illness, and the critique of technological approaches in medicine. These seminars have had a lasting influence on the development of existential psychotherapy and continue to inspire interdisciplinary dialogue between philosophy and psychiatry.",

The 2024 Republican presidential nominee will privately meet with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate. He also will speak at The Believer\u2019s Summit, a Turning Point USA event in West Palm Beach. \nThe meeting with Israel\u2019s head of state could have the most significant policy implications. It notably comes as Democrats assert Trump\u2019s weakness on foreign policy but after neither President Joe Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris greeted Netanyahu at an airport when he arrived in Washington for an address to Congress. \nDonald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu will meet in a key moment for the Trump Campaign.\nIn contrast, Trump said on Truth Social that he deferred to Netanyahu in scheduling the meeting in Palm Beach. Ahead of the meeting, Trump also shared on his social media for the first time that he has received correspondence from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who sent a letter to Trump following an apparent assassination attempt on the Republican. Abbas condemned political violence, notable as conflict continues between Israel and Hamas. \nWhen Trump shared the letter, he stressed a desire to address international policy in his meeting with Netanyahu. \u201cLooking forward to seeing Bibi Netanyahu on Friday, and even more forward to achieving Peace in the Middle East!\u201d Trump posted. \nAs for the summit, Trump is the headliner for the three-day event, including speeches by former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and several conservative religious leaders. Turning Point Action will co-host the event, the political arm of TPUSA, and TPUSA Faith, the organization\u2019s faith outreach group. \n\u201cAt this crucial time in America, the Believers Summit is not just an event; it\u2019s a call for believers to rise in unity and biblical truth with an unshakable faith,\u201d reads a website promoting the summit. \u201cWe are committed to empowering attendees with practical knowledge and strategies to live out their faith boldly and counteract the prevailing \u2018woke\u2019 narratives with grace, truth, and conviction, rooted in the Gospel.\u201d \n\u2013 SITUATIONAL AWARENESS \u2013 \n\u2013@KamalaHarris: Trump agreed on a September 10th debate.

        "summary": "By Christianah Omobosola Babajide. \nReading time: five minutes  \nDr. Tunde Okewale OBE (TO) is an award-winning barrister and a leading figure in social entrepreneurship, renowned for his advocacy and commitment to justice. Originating from a Hackney council estate to achieving distinction at the prestigious Doughty Street Chambers, his journey epitomises resilience and dedication to social mobility. Specialising in serious and financial crimes, he has significantly influenced legal reforms and represented a diverse array of clients, from individuals to high-profile companies. Notably, his work was instrumental in overturning Dwaine George\u2019s wrongful conviction, highlighting his impact on appellate justice. \nCOB: Please start off by telling us a little bit about your background. \nTO: I grew up on a Hackney council estate, a background that many might see as a hindrance, but I viewed it as a source of strength. My Nigerian heritage instilled in me a deep sense of community, resilience, and ambition. My parents taught me the value of hard work and education, and despite the challenges of our environment, they always encouraged me to pursue my dreams. I was the first in my family to attend university, studying law at London Metropolitan University while juggling multiple jobs to support myself. It was a demanding time, but those experiences shaped my character and work ethic. The charity From Boyhood to Manhood provided me with a scholarship, which enabled me to attend Bar School. Their support was instrumental in my journey, and today, I remain a trustee and director for the charity, giving back to the community that believed in me. \nMy professional journey from Hackney to becoming a distinguished barrister at Doughty Street Chambers is a testament to the power of determination and community support. Specialising in serious and financial crimes, I have represented a diverse array of clients, from individuals to high-profile companies, and have significantly influenced legal reforms. One of the highlights of my career was my involvement in overturning Dwaine George\u2019s wrongful conviction, which underscored the importance of justice and appellate advocacy in my work. \nCOB: You\u2019ve achieved numerous accolades throughout your career. How do you stay motivated? \nTO: My motivation comes from a deep-rooted commitment to justice and social mobility. Each accolade, whether it\u2019s being recognised with an MBE in 2016 or an OBE in 2024, serves as a reminder of the impact that dedicated work can have. However, these awards are not the end goal; they are milestones on a much larger journey. Seeing the tangible impact of my work, such as overturning wrongful convictions or mentoring the next generation of lawyers, fuels my passion. The journey from my humble beginnings to these recognitions reminds me that every step I take can inspire others who might be in similar situations. \nMoreover, my Nigerian heritage plays a significant role in my motivation. The values of perseverance, community, and ambition that were instilled in me from a young age continue to drive me forward. I draw inspiration from my parents\u2019 sacrifices and the resilience they demonstrated in overcoming adversity. This personal connection to my roots keeps me grounded and focused on my mission to make a difference.",

        "url": "https://www.wikihow.com/Save-Money",
        "summary": "Deposit a portion of your income in a savings or retirement account. Don't accumulate new debt, and pay off any debt you currently have. Establish a realistic timeframe for your savings goals. Create a budget and keep track of all your expenses. Invest in the stock market only if you understand the ins and outs of the gambles you make. Spend money only on the essentials, and look for cheaper options where available, from housing to food, transportation, or energy usage. Save for an emergency fund. Spend money on luxuries only occasionally.  \n[Edit]Steps\n[Edit]Saving Money Responsibly\nPay yourself first. The easiest way to save money rather than spending it is to make sure that that you never get a chance to spend the money in the first place. Arranging for a portion of each paycheck to be deposited directly into a savings account or a retirement account takes the stress and tedium out of the process of deciding how much money to save and how much to keep for yourself each month \u2014 basically, you save automatically and the money you keep each month is yours to spend as you please. Over time, depositing even a small portion of each paycheck into your savings can add up (especially when you take interest into account) so start as soon as you can for maximum benefit.[1] \nTo set up an automatic deposit, talk to the payroll staff at your job (or, if your employer uses one, your third-party payroll service). If you can provide account information for a savings account separate from your basic checking account, you should generally be able to set up a direct deposit scheme with no problems.\nIf for some reason you can't set up an automatic deposit for each paycheck (like if you support yourself with freelance work or are paid mostly in cash), decide on a specific cash amount to manually deposit into a savings account each month and stick to this goal.\nAvoid accumulating new debt. Some debt is essentially unavoidable. For instance, only the very rich have enough money to buy a house in one lump sum payment, yet millions of people are able to buy houses by taking out loans and slowly paying them back. However, in general, when you can avoid going into debt, do so. Paying a sum of money up-front is always cheaper in the long run than paying off an equivalent loan while interest accumulates over time. \nIf taking out a loan is unavoidable, try to make as big of a down payment as possible. The more of the cost of the purchase you can cover up front, the quicker you'll pay off your loan and the less you'll spend on interest.\nWhile everyone's financial situation differs, most banks recommend that your debt payments should be about 10% of your pretax income, while anything under 20% is considered healthy. About 36% is seen as an \"upper limit\" for reasonable amounts of debt.[2]\nSet reasonable savings goals.[3] It's a lot easier to save if you know you have something to save for. Set yourself savings goals that are within your reach to motivate yourself to make the tough financial decisions needed to save responsibly. For serious goals like buying a house or retiring, your goals may take years or decades to achieve. In these cases, it's important to monitor your progress on a regular basis. Only by stepping back and taking a look at the big picture can you get a sense for how far you've come and how far you have left to go.",

What we find is that the people of the Ancient Near East were the same as we are in every way. It is easy for us to believe that we are better, definitely by technological standards, but actually, people are inherently the same across time. The message of the Bible becomes that much stronger when we see it in light of the fact that if we had lived in Jonah\u2019s time, many of us wouldn\u2019t have responded any better had we even spoken personally with God. And Jonah, a \u201csilly dove,\u201d as indicated by his name, was exactly who God had called out to be as a microcosm of the whole of Israel. He was a sample of the nation of Israel to which he belonged. And we are all likewise children of our time being influenced by the culture in which we live. \n\n\n\nAlthough Jonah was privileged to deliver great prophecies of success and fortune to Jeroboam II, then king of Israel, God knew that their nationalistic zeal was egregious to the original intent of His people, Israel\u2019s mission.",

        "url": "https://desistarsgilrsfunclub.blogspot.com/2024/07/fans-celebrate-williams-bold-move.html",
        "summary": "Prince William, with the permission of King Charles, has made a daring decision regarding the monarchy's concerns over Queen Camilla's son and Prince Harry's involvement. According to an insider source, this choice has the potential to cause Queen Camilla and Prince Harry to get emotional. Princess Catherine will resume her royal duties in early August after successfully recovering from cancer, which included undergoing six months of chemotherapy. In the middle of a challenging year, the British royal family is now encountering a crucial turning point in 2024. The monarchy is facing unprecedented problems, described by insiders as the most difficult experience so far. The notable absence of three key individuals who once played major roles among the working royals has resulted in a significant void. The scarcity of currently engaged individuals from the royal lineage poses a significant obstacle to King Charles's reign. According to insider sources, this circumstance has prompted Prince William to consider taking the throne sooner than initially planned. The current status of employed individuals from royal lineages is an interesting topic. The current cohort of active royals is dwindling, and their advanced ages underscore the pressing urgency of the situation. Here\u2019s a summary of the main persons and their ages:\u00a0  King Charles is 75 years oldQueen Camilla is 76 years oldPrince William, the Prince of Wales, is 42 years oldCatherine, the Princess of Wales, is 42 years oldPrincess Anne is 74 years oldPrince Edward, the Duke of Edinburgh, is 60 years old\u00a0Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, is 59 years old Due to the advanced age of the present squad, there is an increasing need for younger, more dynamic, and inventive figures. Catherine, the Princess of Wales, who has lately fought against cancer, is now confronting health difficulties that worsen the problem. Nonetheless, we expect her to fully recover and resume her responsibilities in August. Prince William is advocating for a contemporary kind of monarchy. Long recognized as the heir to the British monarchy, Prince William is now making efforts to modernize and reform the institution. According to recent developments, the Prince of Wales is likely to adopt a more contemporary and forward-thinking approach to his reign, distinguishing him from his father, King Charles III. Prince William left a lasting impact at a public meeting by highlighting the significance of mental well-being, environmental conservation, and the monarchy's need to establish a deeper rapport with the younger generation. Experts see this change in focus as a deliberate maneuver to guarantee the monarchy's continued significance in an ever-evolving world. The royal family has engaged in extensive discussions on their financial affairs, despite the rise in profits this year. There is still controversy about the expenditures related to sustaining the royal family. One of the most significant decisions was the redistribution of duties formerly undertaken by Prince Harry. King Charles and Prince William have chosen to delegate the responsibility of overseeing the Invictus Games to Mike Tindall, a former rugby player and the spouse of Zara Tindall, who is Princess Anne's daughter. Mike Tindall's expertise in sports and his active participation in public service make him a highly qualified candidate for this significant role. Furthermore, in an effort to save costs, King Charles has decided to withdraw some duties from Queen Camilla. Queen Camilla is very troubled by this choice. According to reliable sources, the British royal family has taken another consequential and sincere choice in the middle of an extremely tumultuous year: King Charles III has decided to end the monetary support given to Tom Parker Bowles, the son of Queen Camilla. This step is a component of a broader strategy aimed at reducing the overall expenses of the monarchy. This choice, while causing sorrow to Queen Camilla, highlights the need for fiscal discipline during these difficult times. Tom Parker Bowles, the son of Queen Camilla and Andrew Parker Bowles, was born as a result of their first marriage. Tom, born on December 18, 1974, is a highly esteemed gourmet author and critic who has authored multiple culinary publications and made frequent appearances on television. Despite his renowned public image, Tom has often remained outside of the central cohort of actively engaged members of the royal family, devoting his endeavors to his culinary vocation. The cessation of financial aid for Tom Parker Bowles is part of a larger effort to streamline the royal family's expenditures. Despite the rise in profits this year, the expenses related to upholding the monarchy have consistently been a point of contention. The Sovereign Grant, which funds the formal duties of the royal family, has received criticism mostly because of concerns about budgetary responsibility. Exclusive sources reveal that this choice has significantly impacted Queen Camilla. Throughout her life, she has constantly shown steadfast support to her children, and the decision to stop providing financial aid has been seen as a very personal failure. However, this activity has happened before. The royal household has a history of making difficult decisions to ensure its long-term sustainability. This action is part of a broader strategy to reduce the financial burden on the monarchy and focus resources on its core members. King Charles intends to enhance the effectiveness and modernity of the royal household by reallocating financial resources and responsibilities. Prince William's vision for a fortified and contemporary monarchy aligns with this choice. Prince William is undergoing leadership training, and King Charles is progressively entrusting further responsibilities to him in anticipation of his eventual ascension to the throne. Experts view this transitional stage as a crucial step to guarantee a seamless and uninterrupted succession. Prince William has expressed apprehensions about taking on more duties, especially considering his wife's recent health difficulties. He has emphasized the need to prioritize his family at this challenging moment. Despite these concerns, private sources reveal that the next year will be crucial for Prince William as he prepares to take on the full responsibilities of a potential king. The anticipated recovery and return of Princess Catherine in August will also have a substantial influence on this transition. Princess Catherine has announced her involvement in many new projects, demonstrating her readiness to resume her royal duties. Her unwavering dedication to early childhood development, a topic she has always been passionate about, is one of the most eagerly anticipated endeavors. Prince William expects her presence to provide crucial stability and support during this transitional era. The British royal family is undeniably facing one of its most challenging periods. Due to the absence of significant figures and the need for a more modern approach, it is more likely that Prince William will ascend to the throne sooner. To preserve the continued significance and durability of the monarchy, it is crucial for King Charles and Prince William to cooperate and make essential arrangements for this transitional phase. Princess Catherine's involvement and the reassignment of responsibilities within the royal household will be critical in achieving this goal. The next few months will be a pivotal period for the royal family, and the international community will closely monitor their management of these unprecedented challenges.",

        "summary": "As the 2024 Olympic Games commence, the world's top athletes will float down the Seine, walk under the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, and compete in the 33rd iteration of the centuries old competition. Backing their push for the podium \u2014 resting in the technologically adept hands of coaches, athletes, and viewers, alike \u2014 is a more modern player: AI.\u00a0 The International Olympic Committee (IOC) published its \"Olympic AI Agenda\" earlier this year, a \"holistic approach to explore the great potential of AI, while mitigating the risks,\" the organization explained. The agenda set out a future-forward list of goals, which include game optimization, talent detection, and the \"reduction of human bias.\" Many of those are being tested for the first time in Paris. Intel, an Olympic Partner since 2017, is the event's 5G, Process, and AI platform partner, with the former title more relevant than ever at the 2024 games. The company has spent the last five years building out their established line of hardware and software offerings to aid the IOC's vision of bringing AI into sports.\u00a0 \n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            How to make the most of the Olympics on Peacock\n            \n        \n    \nSarah Vickers, head of Intel\u2019s Olympic and Paralympic program, told Mashable that she believes AI will have its biggest Olympic impact in areas like event operations, the data-hungry world of broadcasting, and the fan experience itself.\u00a0 \"The Olympic ecosystem has had a rough couple of years,\" Vickers said outside of the company's on-the-ground AI Lab in Paris. \"Now, if you think about it, all of the dynamics of the traditional games are back. There\u2019s fans in the stands, there\u2019s lots of people moving around, there\u2019s a lot of operational challenges. The other thing is that the expectations of the user and of athletes have changed. They are used to having information at their fingertips. It\u2019s this perfect timing for us to be able to demonstrate how we\u2019re showing AI everywhere.\u201d Intel isn't the only company fulfilling Olympic dreams through AI. On Monday, Google, Team USA, and NBCUniversal announced an official partnership that named the tech giant Team USA's \"Official Search AI Partner.\" The deal will see Google's AI offerings combined with live NBC coverage, game explanations, and user Olympic searches.\u00a0 The IOC is revving up its AI game in a period of intense growth across the tech industry, with the hope of bringing back historic viewer numbers and, more subtly, cutting costs \u2014 but even they have to consider the wider implications of AI. In conversation with Vickers on Intel's Technically Speaking podcast, Ilario Corna, Chief Information Technology Officer at the IOC, said that the IOC is thinking as intensely about trust as it is innovations, which may soon mean building their own \"OlympicGPT.\" As the IOC and its partners dive head first into AI, many of the games' biggest swings may go undetected by its audience, operating behind-the-scenes at the world's most historic sporting event.\u00a0 AI is helping digitize the competitionIntel has been leading the game's growing technology investments for years, including the opening ceremony show at the 2022 Beijing games, which featured hundreds of Intel Premium drones. Those games also saw the arrival of artificially intelligent platforms. But the Paris games offer the first time many of Intel's tech will be deployed at scale.",

        "title": "How Electric Vehicles Support Public Health.",
        "url": "https://www.electricbee.co/how-electric-vehicles-support-public-health/",
        "summary": "photo/courtesyElectric vehicles (EVs) are rapidly becoming a cornerstone of the global transition to sustainable transportation.  Beyond their environmental benefits, EVs play a crucial role in supporting public health.  This article explores how electric vehicles improve public health through reduced air pollution, noise pollution, and other key factors. 1. Reduction in Air PollutionTraditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are significant sources of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  These pollutants are linked to numerous health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and premature death.  EVs offer a clean alternative by producing zero tailpipe emissions. Here\u2019s how they help: Lowered Respiratory Issues: Reduced emissions mean fewer pollutants that can trigger asthma attacks, bronchitis, and other respiratory conditions.Decreased Cardiovascular Risks: Air pollution from ICE vehicles is associated with heart disease and stroke. EVs help lower these risks by reducing harmful emissions.Fewer Cancer Cases: Certain pollutants from ICE vehicles are carcinogenic. EVs contribute to lower cancer risk by emitting none of these hazardous substances.2. Reduction in Noise PollutionNoise pollution is an often-overlooked environmental hazard that affects millions of people, leading to stress, sleep disturbances, and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.  EVs are significantly quieter than ICE vehicles, especially at low speeds. This reduction in noise pollution has several health benefits: Improved Sleep Quality: Quieter streets lead to better sleep patterns and overall improved mental health.Lower Stress Levels: Reduced noise pollution contributes to lower stress and anxiety levels, improving overall well-being.Enhanced Cognitive Function: Less noise disruption is beneficial for cognitive functions, particularly in children and the elderly.3. Improvement in Urban Air QualityEVs help improve air quality in urban areas, where pollution levels are typically highest due to dense traffic. Improved air quality leads to: Healthier Urban Populations: Reduced exposure to harmful pollutants translates to fewer health problems and a healthier population.Reduced Health Care Costs: Fewer health issues mean lower medical costs for both individuals and public health systems.Increased Life Expectancy: Cleaner air can contribute to a longer lifespan for urban residents.4. Promotion of Active LifestylesThe adoption of EVs often goes hand-in-hand with urban planning that promotes sustainable transport options, including walking and cycling.  This has several public health benefits: Increased Physical Activity: Well-designed urban spaces encourage walking and cycling, leading to better physical health and reduced obesity rates.Reduced Sedentary Lifestyle: Active transportation options decrease sedentary behavior, which is linked to numerous chronic diseases.5. Reduction in Greenhouse Gas EmissionsEVs play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which are responsible for climate change.  Climate change has significant public health implications, including increased heat-related illnesses, the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water security challenges.  By mitigating climate change, EVs help: Protect Vulnerable Populations: Reduced climate change impacts mean fewer health risks for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions.Prevent Heat-Related Illnesses: Lower GHG emissions help combat extreme heat events, reducing the incidence of heat-related illnesses and deaths.Mitigate the Spread of Diseases: By stabilizing the climate, EVs indirectly help prevent the spread of climate-sensitive diseases.6. Support for Mental HealthCleaner, quieter, and more pleasant urban environments contribute to better mental health.  The reduction in air and noise pollution from EVs leads to: Improved Mental Well-being: Cleaner air and quieter streets enhance overall mental health, reducing rates of depression and anxiety.Better Quality of Life: Healthier, more livable cities contribute to a better quality of life for residents.ConclusionElectric vehicles are more than just a technological advancement; they are a vital tool for improving public health.  EVs offer comprehensive public health benefits by reducing air and noise pollution, enhancing urban air quality, promoting active lifestyles, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and supporting mental health.  As the adoption of electric vehicles continues to grow, the positive impact on public health will become increasingly evident, making a compelling case for the widespread transition to cleaner, greener transportation solutions.",

        "title": "Give Me Your Sweet Sweet Trauma",
        "url": "https://archieproudfoot.substack.com/p/give-me-your-sweet-sweet-trauma",
        "summary": "One of the easiest ways to get attention online is deliver up your trauma on a platter. Your pain, they love it. Strangers in their hundreds, or thousands, or maybe even hundreds of thousands dining out on your distress - gorging themselves on it. It really cuts through the noise. Trauma is stronger even than the diesel power that keeps social media running day and night: Envy. Forget your brand partnership with Nike, I want to hear about your Dad\u2019s suicide! Now that is content. Conversely, one of the worst ways to get attention in real life is bear your soul and start talking all about your most painful experiences. People don\u2019t want to hear - keep it light, yeh, I just paid \u00a36.95 for a pint of lager in a warm glass and I\u2019m awkwardly perched on the end of picnic bench in a cold concrete pub garden getting burned on the back of my neck by the oppressive orange glow of the heater. Even discussing the trauma of others is frowned upon - why are we talking about the hundreds of charred bodies of Palestinian children right now? Back to memes, back to football, back to remember when. Subscribe now So what is this? This Second Life of intense emotional resonance that can be found online with your \u2018community\u2019 of avatars. Why do the little circular profile pictures of strangers perform better than people you\u2019ve known for years when you need words of support? I think it boils down to the fact that the vast majority of people are cowards. I\u2019m a coward, you probably are too. It\u2019s OK, we can be scared together. Only psychopaths don\u2019t feel the fear. Real life people are scary and unpredictable. Everyone has moments seared into their memories where an off-hand comment landed somewhere soft on someone else. You may have actually seen the moment when their eyes glazed over and the internal bleeding started from the knife you inadvertently just stuck in their side. You won\u2019t forget that, you\u2019ll be more careful next time. Online existence is very different, you\u2019re much safer behind that phone screen. People still exist but only as images. If you misjudge a comment you won\u2019t see those eyes glaze over and their body language droop, you probably won\u2019t know you\u2019ve hurt someone at all. The worst case scenario is they reply to your comment with a rebuttal which you can either ignore or use to start a little beef that will end whenever you can\u2019t be bothered to reply anymore. That base of safety is what allows people to engage with the big scary emotional experiences of others more readily. Grief is a great example of this. Anyone who has been through a major grief, like the loss of a family member who has died too young, will have experienced the culture of silence when they re-enter social life. All those cowards struggling to think of something to say that won\u2019t sound flippant or insensitive so they just say nothing at all. I\u2019ve been through that experience, I know what it means to have what\u2019s happened acknowledged by friends and acquaintances but I still really struggle when the boot is on the other foot and I\u2019m the one that has to do the scary thing and try to say something, anything, to someone in unseen emotional pain. We just aren\u2019t really equipped with the language to offer that support with any humanity. Still, when you next find yourself in that situation remember that trite and awkward is a lot better than silent and cowardly for the person going through it - suck it up and say something. The problem is that its very hard to swim against the current that underpins 99% of social interactions in real life which is: let\u2019s have fun. If you\u2019re not having fun are you having a social experience of value? This isn\u2019t innate to the human experience, its an attitude that\u2019s been moulded over decades of messaging in advertising: If only you could buy this watch or drink this beer or wear this necklace you and your ethnically balanced group of stunning friends would be having the best time! You might think that beer tastes like shit or that necklace is tacky but the messaging still works its way in. When people are together they\u2019re meant to be having a good time. Even work is supposed to be fun now.  Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I like to have a good time. But its not the full breadth of the human experience is it? Our capacity for what Keats called \u2018Negative Capability\u2019 has been stunted by contemporary life\u2019s obsession with good vibes at all times. Its part of why we have a mental health crisis that is deepening by the day. The finger is often lazily pointed at the social media companies for this crisis, but the problems run much deeper and well beyond the scope of this Substack. For now lets stick with the delicate subject of how trauma processing can become entwined with engagement analytics. Posts that relate to serious trauma have the power to cut through the social media sludge because they offer something deeply real. If you were to show your capsule collection collab with Nike to a person ten thousand years ago they would find the DryFit\u2122 fabric fascinating but the status of it would mean nothing to them. Show that same early human a photo of your sister that died in an accident and they would feel closer to you, they could share in your pain (let\u2019s leave aside the fact they would be wowed by the photo as well, you get my point - one is real the other isn\u2019t). This cut through means good numbers on those posts. To look at a post about a trauma in that way feels incredibly cynical, but we shouldn\u2019t pretend those numbers don\u2019t have an emotional effect. That dopamine hit from the likes is designed to pull you in, and the attention is seductive after being ignored out in the real world. Heart emojis of various colours start to flow and finally you begin to feel seen and heard. The algorithm loves this. Loads of comments, likes, people taking the time to read a caption - lets show this to everyone! And so the momentum builds and you feel like the captured audience need more, more angles, objects and reflections from this traumatic experience. Before you know it you\u2019ve bared your soul to thousands of strangers in a multitude of ways.  In the first few months after my Dad\u2019s death (by Cancer not suicide, that was just an example for extra drama) the initial flush of grief created a highly energised manic mood. I can only see this now, several years on, at the time I felt like I was processing and I was but just with a panicked edge. I was rushing to establish his legacy, who he was and what he stood for in very public terms without really thinking about what I was exposing of myself and my family. I don\u2019t regret any of those posts, at the time they helped, but they came from a naive place in my understanding of grief. Now I can see the bigger picture of grief as a life partner I feel differently. Its a slow burn pain. Once that initial fire has died down the embers flare up every few weeks or months and the loss comes back to you vivd and sharp. There\u2019s no telling what will cause a flare up, it can be something obvious like seeing a photo or something totally innocuous. In between the flares it feels like nothing at all, because it has to, because you have to keep putting one foot in front of another and get on with everything else in your life. I had forgotten what this strong cocktail of personal pain and social media success felt like until I wrote about my discovering my daughter\u2019s autism for this Substack. That piece also came from a naive place. I just needed something to write that week. No part of me thought it would spill out into a much wider audience, that it would land with so many people, or that I would be fielding DMs, emails and comments for weeks afterwards. I left a lot of the pain of the experience out of that piece. There is a grieving process that happens when you realise your child is going to potentially have a very different life from their neurotypical peers, that they may never verbally communicate, that they may never say \u2018I love you\u2019 back. And the anxiety, stress and pressure of trying to understand why my baby was reacting so differently to all the others was a kind of trauma for me and my wife. Little t trauma rather than big T trauma perhaps - but lets not get too deep into that distinction, I\u2019m no expert. Just as with my Dad\u2019s death a few years before I had found it easier to clarify my feelings by publishing them to thousands of strangers rather than in conversations with friends and family.  Once again I was faced with a decision: to lean in and give the audience more or that sweet sweet trauma or to pull back. Maybe it actually mattered that I, especially as a Dad, took the time to lay out that experience, maybe my perspective was a missing part of the conversation about neurodivergence, maybe I should sack off this art nonsense and become a full time Autism Dadfluencer! Or maybe not. A few years older and wiser since my last drunken experience on cocktails made with one part trauma three parts engagement I decided to pull back. If I want to share more I will, but it won\u2019t be because I\u2019m chasing the dopamine high from the likes and comments of strangers - at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m telling myself. The problem is that the personal is the pepper that really makes a piece of content sing. Being a good storyteller and being a good artist involves making yourself vulnerable. Its important to expose some of your wounds because otherwise how will anyone know you\u2019re human? You\u2019re just an image on a screen to these people remember. The dose of reality these chunks of trauma provide cuts through the noise because we either know them already or we fear their arrival in our lives. Real recognises real. Its not our fault that the mediums we use to express them to a wider audience are delivering this pain in bad faith. All they care about is that you spend as much time on their platforms as possible - if its trauma that keeps you there then trauma you shall have. But ultimately, if these online spaces offer the person who has experienced a trauma a space into which they can express with relative freedom then they are a good thing. Away from the oppressive heat of the pub garden heater, without the frustration of being cut off mid flow by someone asking if anyone wants another drink so they can escape the discomfort, safely behind our screens we can express and consume that sweet sweet trauma.  This Substack is free but paid subscribers are very much appreciated. You can also support me and my work by buying something from my online store. You get something beautiful for your walls and I get to keep bitching about \u00a36.95 pints - its a win win",

        "url": "https://roberthubbell.substack.com/p/the-harris-campaign-kicks-into-high",
        "summary": "Kamala Harris has the Trump campaign on its back foot. Whatever Trump\u2019s advisers expected from V.P. Harris, they were wrong. Although Trump and his surrogates have tried several lines of attack, each attempt backfires as Trump offends important constituencies he needs to win. In attacking Kamala Harris, Trump is offending Black Americans, successful women, mothers raising blended families, couples trying to conceive, young people, and more. The Harris campaign has responded forcefully, using a pointed sense of humor that is refreshing and attractive to younger voters who see the internet as a battlefield of ideas. On Thursday, the Harris campaign released a powerful television ad that was a \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d look at the threat to democracy posed by Trump. See The Guardian, \u2018We choose freedom\u2019: Kamala Harris campaign launches first ad. The ad is embedded in The Guardian article; I urge you to watch it. If you don\u2019t, here is The Guardian\u2019s description of the ad: Released on Thursday morning, the ad opens with shots of Harris\u2019s smiling face behind a podium, the word Kamala, the word Harris, and the American flag. The soundtrack is the beginning of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song Freedom, to which Harris entered and exited her first speech to campaign staffers after gaining lightning speed momentum on the road to becoming the presumptive nominee. The ad is narrated by Harris, whose first words are, \u201cIn this election we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in?\u201d She continues: \u201cThere are some people who think we should be a country of chaos. Of fear. Of hate,\u201d she says, over shots of Trump and JD Vance. \u201cBut us, we choose something different.\u201d On social media, the Harris campaign has been even more aggressive. The Harris campaign took a clip of Trump imitating Kamala Harris, saying, \u201cI\u2019m the prosecutor and he is the convicted felon.\u201d  After Trump admits that he is a convicted felon and Harris is a prosecutor, the ad immediately cuts to a picture of Kamala Harris with her voice saying, \u201cI am Kamala Harris and I approve this message.\u201d The Harris campaign is showing early signs of social media savvy\u2014just as Barack Obama\u2019s campaign did in 2008. The Harris campaign also went after JD Vance, who described Kamala Harris in 2021 as a \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d who should not have an equal voice in the future of America because she does not have biological children. (Harris is a stepmother to two children with Doug Emhoff.) Thursday was \u201cIn Vitro Fertilization Day.\u201d The Harris campaign released a statement saying, \u201cHappy World IVF Day To Everyone Except JD Vance.\u201d See HuffPo, Harris Campaign Wishes Happy World IVF Day To Everyone Except 1 Person. The confidence and swagger of that ad was reflected in the Harris campaign\u2019s immediate acceptance of debate with Donald Trump, set for September 10. But as Kamala Harris demonstrated an eagerness to debate, Trump began hedging his bets, saying he \u201cdid not like the idea\u201d of a debate on ABC. See CNBC, \u2018Let\u2019s go\u2019: Harris agrees to debate Trump, accuses him of \u2018backpedaling\u2019 on Sept. 10 date. The Harris campaign also used social media to troll Trump's morning appearance on Fox News, during which Trump called Kamala Harris \u201cgarbage.\u201d The Harris campaign issued a press release entitled Statement on a 78-Year-Old Criminal\u2019s Fox News Appearance. The press release said, After watching Fox News this morning we only have one question, is Donald Trump ok? Trump is old and quite weird [and] this guy shouldn\u2019t be president ever again. For their part, Trump and his surrogates were reduced to claiming that Kamala Harris is a \u201cDEI hire,\u201d a \u201cfailed border czar,\u201d and a socialist who will destroy the economy of America. Luckily for Kamala Harris, economic growth and border security both improved in the second quarter. On Thursday, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the gross domestic product grew at a 2.8% rate in the second quarter, well above the consensus prediction of 1.9% by economists. See USA Today, US GDP report: Latest data shows economy grew 2.8% in Q2 (usatoday.com) At the border, crossings by immigrants dropped to their lowest level since 2020 (under Donald Trump). See CBS News, Migrant crossings continue to plunge, nearing the level that would lift Biden's border crackdown. Per CBS News, July is on track to see the fifth consecutive monthly drop in migrant apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border and the lowest level in illegal immigration there since the fall of 2020, during the Trump administration, the internal Department of Homeland Security figures show. My point in noting the responses by the Harris campaign is not to revel in the \u201czingers\u201d and \u201csmackdowns\u201d that are long overdue. Rather, it is to highlight the nimbleness, swagger, and professionalism of the Harris campaign. The lightning-quick responses would be exemplary for any presidential campaign; they are stunning for a presidential campaign that is four days old. Although it is still early, it seems clear that the Harris campaign will focus on Trump's criminality, incoherence, age, and hateful agenda. And it is doing so with a satirical edge that transfers easily into internet memes\u2014which is an effective way to create viral messaging that reaches young people. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has been caught flat-footed, trying to ignore the awkward creepiness of JD Vance and Trump's part-time approach to campaigning. All of this should give Democrats confidence that Kamala Harris will run a strong campaign against an opponent who will wage a vile and hate-filled counter-offensive. If the first few days of the campaign are any indication, Kamala Harris is up to the task.  Speeches by Kamala Harris on ThursdayV.P. Harris gave two significant speeches on Thursday. The first was to the American Federation of Teachers in Houston. V.P. Harris said, in part, There are those who are really trying to take us backward. Donald Trump and his extreme allies want to take us back to failed trickle-down economic policies, back to union busting, back to tax breaks for billionaires. Donald Trump and his allies want to cut Medicare and Social Security, to stop student-loan forgiveness for teachers and other public servants, and I say to AFT, they even want to eliminate the Department of Education and end Head Start, which of course would take away preschool from hundreds of thousands of our children. In a second speech after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, V.P. Harris adopted a tougher tone in calling for Israel to conclude a cease-fire and secure the return of the hostages. See The Guardian, Kamala Harris says \u2018I will not be silent\u2019 on suffering in Gaza after Netanyahu talks. The Guardian described the speech as follows: Harris\u2019 forceful remarks on Thursday, which were sharp and serious in tone, reflected what might mark a departure from Biden in how she deals with Netanyahu. Some noted the significance of Harris being the one to give public remarks after both she and Biden had separately met the prime minister.  Vance makes it impossible for Trump to deny knowledge of Project 2025Trump has been pretending that he is not aware of the proposals in Project 2025\u2014the blueprint for an authoritarian takeover of the federal government if Trump is re-elected. But JD Vance has made it impossible for Trump to maintain the fiction that he is unaware of those ideas. Vance ha written the forward to an upcoming book by Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, who describes himself as the \u201chead\u201d of Project 2025. The book is Dawn\u2019s Early Light, Taking Back Washington To Save America. Roberts\u2019 book will be published in September\u2014during the heart of the presidential campaign. Vance writes the following about the ideas in the book (which track Project 2025): Never before has a figure with Roberts\u2019s depth and stature within the American Right tried to articulate a genuinely new future for conservatism. We are now all realizing that it\u2019s time to circle the wagons and load the muskets. In the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon. The book was originally titled, \u201cDawn\u2019s Early Light: Burning Down Washington to Save America,\u201d with a cover image showing a match over the word \u201cWashington.\u201d See Vox, JD Vance\u2019s ties to Project 2025 and Kevin Roberts may be a problem for Trump. The book title apparently changed as insiders realized that Vance might become the GOP vice presidential nominee.  This is encouraging . . .The Guardian newspaper has published a statement about how it plans to cover V.P. Harris in the presidential campaign. Georgia Warren, the editorial director, interviewed a Guardian reporter, Lauren N Williams, about covering Kamala Harris. Here is part of Warren\u2019s report on that interview: Lauren [said] \u201c[T]hat doesn\u2019t mean we should glorify her. Kamala Harris is not America's savior; she is a politician who is running for president. But if the GOP is trying to control the conversation and use offensive rhetoric to keep us away from issues that really matter, it\u2019s our job as journalists not to be driven by their agenda, and instead to redirect the public conversation to the candidates\u2019 platforms, policies and political histories.\u201d While our reporting on Harris will always be rigorous, Lauren reminds us that \u201cwe cannot treat Trump and Harris as two candidates who are on the same playing field with regard to the threat they pose to democracy. It must always be reiterated: Donald Trump is the only candidate who has 34 felony convictions and tried to overthrow the government.\u201d Let\u2019s hope that The Guardian adheres to its pledge to avoid \u201cfalse equivalencies\u201d and to redirect the story to policies and political histories when Republicans engage in unfair attacks on Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, the NYTimes is continuing its lopsided, biased reporting that seems to give Trump a pass while criticizing everyone else in ways that fail to acknowledge the fundamental asymmetry described by The Guardian. David Brooks has a piece in the Times today (which I won\u2019t link to) that is reminiscent of the Times\u2019s take on Hillary Clinton, i.e., \u201cInsiders don\u2019t like her because she is a tough boss.\u201d \u00a0  Opportunities for Reader engagementJoin me as I host a Today\u2019s Edition discussion and fundraiser for Rep. Dan Goldman. Join me on Thursday, August 1, 2024, at 5:00 pm Pacific / 8:00 pm Eastern as I join in a conversation with Rep. Dan Goldman of NY-10. Dan represents NY-10 in Western Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan. A former federal prosecutor and the lead counsel in the first impeachment of Donald Trump, Dan brings unmatched experience defending the rule of law, and a common sense, practical approach to Congress. He\u2019s quickly become a leader on gun violence, reproductive and voting rights, while also bringing a pragmatic, pro-capitalism approach to addressing the issues that impact the country \u2014 mental health, public safety, creating jobs and expanding the tax base, and ensuring businesses can thrive. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ev_08.01.24 Give A Week to Save Democracy! Will you give a week of your time to save democracy? The most effective way to help Democrats win in November is to knock on doors and talk to potential voters in swing states. Join Progressive Turnout Project on Tuesday, August 13 at 8pm ET / 5pm PT to hear how you can join the effort!  Leading grassroots organizations nationwide will join us in hosting a YouTube Live event to encourage volunteers to step up in a big way.  We'll be joined by special guests,\u00a0Anderson Clayton, North Carolina Democratic Party Chair (at 26, the youngest party chair in the nation) and\u00a0Lavora Barnes, Michigan Democratic Party Chair since 2019.  Progressive Turnout Project's Flexible Paid Door-Knocking Program is perfect for folks who are able to travel to a swing state and help on the ground for days, a week or longer. You can make $250 per day to offset your travel expenses. And we'll share other ways people can make a difference. RSVP:\u00a0https://www.mobilize.us/ptp/event/649543/ Concluding Thoughts  As we approach the end of the first week of Kamala Harris\u2019s candidacy, things are going better than anyone expected. We should enjoy our good fortune, but prepare ourselves for a tough fight. The RNC just announced it will spend $68 million to attack Kamala Harris. Ouch! $68 million is a LOT of money in negative advertising.  Everyone should resolve now not to be deterred or dispirited by the negative attacks on Kamala Harris. That is what happened (in part) to Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Let\u2019s keep our nerve, our wits, and our focus. We have a strong candidate who can withstand the attacks\u2014as long as we have her back. Let\u2019s not falter; instead, let\u2019s turn those attacks back on the GOP as evidence of that party\u2019s dark vision of a divided America. With our help, Kamala Harris will point the way to a more tolerant, just, and inclusive America. Talk to you tomorrow! +++++++++++++ Below is a photo of the Eagle Nebula (M16), taken on 7/24/24 in Los Angeles with a 90-minute exposure. M16 is a star-forming region 7,000 light years from Earth. The large gas columns in the photo are known as the \u201cPillars of Creation.\u201d  A reader sent an email that asked, \u201cWhat is a \u201cnebula\u201d? In 1760, Charles Messier was searching for comets using a four-inch refractor telescope. He kept finding \u201cfuzzy blobs\u201d that were not comets (they remained stationary in the night sky relative to the stars). To save himself and other astronomers the trouble of tracking those stationary fuzzy blobs, Messier kept a list of those fuzzy objects and their locations. He called those fuzzy objects \u201cnebula\u201d\u2014from the Latin for \u201cclouds.\u201d That list became what we know as the Messier Catalog. Objects included in the list have the prefix \u201cM\u201d followed by a number from 1 to 110 to correspond to the objects that Messier (and others) included on the list. In an ironic twist, the Messier Catalog lists the most important and interesting deep-sky objects visible from Earth with a small(ish) telescope. Rather than collecting objects to be ignored, the Messier Catalog contains the jewels of our solar system and beyond. Messier objects include gas clouds (like M63, the Eagle Nebula), remnants of exploded stars (supernovae) that are generally round (hence the term \u201cplanetary nebula\u201d), galaxies (which were called spiral nebula) and star clusters (like the Pleiades).  One more fun fact: Despite the solid-looking appearance of the Pillars of Creation in the photo below, the particle density of those structures is far lower (on average) than the best vacuum that can be created on Earth. In the immortal words of Douglas Adams, \u201cSpace is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is.\u201d The uncountable gas particles shown in the photo are sparsely scattered in the vast, nearly empty vacuum of space. I promise not to turn this newsletter into an astronomy blog, but once you get me started talking about astronomy (and science), you can\u2019t shut me up!",

        "summary": "Nutritional Needs with Age: As we age, our body\u2019s nutritional requirements change. By the age of 40, the digestive system can slow down. This can make it harder to digest heavy and oily foods. The body\u2019s energy needs also decrease with age. Hence, it becomes essential to adjust our diet accordingly. Foods high in fat and calories can impact health negatively. The risk of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure increases. To avoid these problems, a balanced diet is necessary. Opting for low-oil and low-spice food is a better choice. Such a diet helps maintain good health even as we age.\n\n\n\nProtein Needs: Even after the age of 40, the body still needs protein. Protein is essential for muscle strength and overall health. Mutton and chicken are good sources of protein. They can be safely consumed with less oil and spices. Boiling or grilling is a better way to cook them. This makes the food lighter and easier to digest. A protein-rich diet helps maintain energy levels. It prevents muscle breakdown. It\u2019s important to consume the right amount of protein. Too much or too little protein can have negative health effects.\n\n\n\nFats and Cholesterol: Mutton and chicken contain fats and cholesterol. After the age of 40, it\u2019s important to avoid high fat and cholesterol. High cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease. Therefore, food with low fat and cholesterol is better. Chicken is easier to digest and considered safer than mutton. Cooking chicken with less oil and spices makes it easier to digest. Boiled or grilled chicken is a better option. Regular health check-ups are necessary to monitor cholesterol levels. Adopting a healthy lifestyle and balanced diet is crucial.",

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

        "summary": "Intergenerational relationships Relationships between generations, which include interactions between people of various ages, are important in improving well-being across various generations. These interactions cover grandparent-grandchild interactions, teacher-student relationships, as well as community links across ages. The beneficial effects of these connections on the overall well-being of individuals cannot be overstated. \nOne of the key benefits of connections between generations is the passing down of wisdom from older adults to the younger ones. Grandparents, for example, often provide important guidance and knowledge for their grandchildren, passing down experiences, values, and traditions. This interaction builds a feeling of belonging and identity for the younger generation, providing them with a strong foundation for navigating life?s challenges. \nMoreover, intergenerational relationships help emotional health of individuals by giving emotional support beyond age groups. Older adults, through their life stories and resilience, offer understanding, empathy, and emotional support to young people with personal problems. In turn, younger people offer new ideas, energy, and purpose to the lives of older adults, reducing loneliness and isolation that can sometimes happen with aging. \nThese bonds also enhance mental health by creating opportunities for education, creativity, and self-improvement. For instance, older adults can teach their skills, hobbies, and wisdom with younger people, fostering a sense of curiosity and intellectual engagement. Conversely, youth often bring new technology, trends, and ideas to seniors, thereby promoting mental agility and adaptability. Such dynamic interactions add to the mental health of both generations. \nMore broadly, bonds between generations have significant societal implications. By bridging the gap between different age groups, these bonds encourage understanding and respect, thereby lowering age-related prejudice and stereotypes. Age-diverse connections also help pass on cultural heritage, traditions, and values, preserving collective wisdom and strengthening social bonds within communities. \nIn today\u2019s busy and tech-centric world, efforts to foster and promote connections between generations are increasingly important. As families spread out and social systems change, planned actions to promote age-diverse connections are key. Organizations, schools, and communities can play a pivotal role in creating platforms for intergenerational interaction, such as learning programs that involve all ages, community projects, and shared activities that encourage conversation and understanding. \nFurthermore, policies and initiatives that support communities with diverse ages and intergenerational homes can give solid support for creating important bonds between older and younger individuals. These shared living environments not only solve housing issues but also create environments where mutual support, companionship, and collaboration can flourish. \nIn conclusion, the role of intergenerational relationships in promoting well-being cannot be overstated. From the transfer of wisdom and knowledge to the emotional and cognitive benefits, these bonds enhance lives of all ages. By understanding the worth of these bonds and creating chances for interaction, we can build stronger, more cohesive communities and enhance well-being for everyone. The magic of intergenerational relationships lies in their ability to build connections, understanding, and strength, forming a network of shared experiences that uplifts and sustains each generation.",

I\u2019m Calli, we\u2019re 9 people, 4 are diabetics, who depend on me and my partner mostly after the in-laws lost everything on a house fire on November. My partner fucked up his back from months of carrying water every day as  we\u2019ve been months without running water. He\u2019s been bed bound a week and counting. He needs meds and  help 24/7 to move. Also, his mental health has been terrible since he lost his granny on the fire. My in-law has a cataract and any sight she has left is affected by the crash on her glasses. She needs new glasses. I\u2019ve been without my meds for a week+, I have multiple ailments like my liver and gallbladder can\u2019t process a lot of stuff, a tumor and multiple growths on my legs/tights that hurt. We\u2019ve had no luck these past week, eating only a meal a day of rice or plain tortillas is not great for any of us. We\u2019ve been unable to get a decent job and I just came back from a sudden oddjob carrying and moving heavy packages and furniture to make some very urgently needed money but it further fucked my hernia, my hip and my feet which burn from just walking. We\u2019re unemployed looking for anything that can get us enough to eat but we have 100 problems and 99 could be solved with money, money we can\u2019t get without a job no one has given us. Not to mention we have not been able to work on rebuilding the house in months. Overall we need a lot of help, we have a deadline for some bills on July 29th. $34/$952Pay\u2022pal    Ko-fi*This money will cover medical attention, medication, bottled water, food, glasses, laundrymat, transportation, special cushion for hemorrhoides and ci\u00e1tica and orthopaedic insole/shoes stuff. Last post About the fire. Proof compilation post Kitty post DEADLINE ON THE 29THWe have five days but honestly, getting food is far far more URGENT!! FOUR DAYS UNTIL DEADLINE Not to be alarmist but we\u2019re flooding here. And still not water service?  This is so ironic",

Either way, I\u2019ll try to answer this question for you, drawing from my own experiences of self-reflection and overcoming challenges. Why self-improvement is necessarySelf-improvement is essential because it leads to profound changes, both internally and externally. It transforms everything about you, including your mindset and how you view yourself. When I look at my past self, I can\u2019t feel other than happiness for overcoming many challenges to reach where I am\u00a0now. I don\u2019t regret the pain I endured; I regret the opportunities I didn\u2019t take because I was too\u00a0afraid.The point of\u00a0lifeLife is a game and each area of life is a map that we should discover and\u00a0conquer. Persevering through challenges and feeling that you\u2019ve accomplished something gives you a feeling of confidence that can\u2019t be\u00a0matched. There\u2019s no point in living a dull life where you do the bare minimum to survive and indulge in instant pleasures. That\u2019s the life many people lead, and it\u2019s why mental health issues are so prevalent in today\u2019s societies. Final thoughtsBuild your collection of failures so that you become the person worthy of success and happiness. Write a story worth\u00a0reading. I hope you learned something from this post! If so, a clap or a comment could encourage me to write more\u00a0:) Thank you for reading! See you in the next\u00a0article.

The Call to action outlines the global need to care for the vulnerable, protect workers, boost resilience using data and science, and limit global average temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C.\u00a0 The climate crisis is driving temperatures up to unbearable levels all over the world leading to heat-related deaths, heat-related illnesses and putting strain on health systems all over the world. Heat stress is the leading cause of weather-related deaths and estimates show that approximately 489 000 heat-related deaths occurred each year between 2000 and 2019. \u201cExtreme heat is the most visible effect of climate change, everyone is affected,\u201d said Dr Maria Neira, Director of the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health at the World Health Organization. \u201cThose with   existing health conditions will be made much worse with extreme heat and it impacts the health of everyone in sometimes surprising ways. Even mental health is affected by heat, making people confused, anxious or even violent.\u201d Acute and prolonged exposure to excess heat causes heat stress on the body and exacerbates underlying illnesses including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health, asthma and kidney disease. It can increase the risk of accidents, adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, and heighten the transmission of some infectious diseases. In extreme heat conditions, untreated heat stress can lead to heat stroke, which can be a fatal medical emergency. The good news is that heat-related illnesses and deaths are preventable. There are evidence-based actions and tools which   save lives and significantly limit the health impacts of extreme heat. We can protect the most vulnerable through public awareness of how to keep cool, heat-ready social protection and health systems, \u00a0scale up heat-health warning systems to alert authorities and the public, and foster nature-based solutions in cities to reduce excess urban heat. According to estimates in a report produced by WHO, the global scale-up of heat health-warning systems for 57 countries alone has the potential to save almost 100 000 lives per year. The WHO co-sponsors the Global Heat Health Information Network\u00a0bringing together UN agencies,   governments, experts, and civil society partners to share knowledge and scale solutions for protecting communities from extreme heat worldwide.

Donate to Emergency: Help Evacuate My Family From GAZA WAR, organized by Ahmed Alshawish I\u2019ve witnessed the evidence of the tragedy that has struck our lives in Gaza, where my family and I have survived amidst numerous previous wars.\u00a0But today, we face the most dangerous and fierce battle in the current war. The urgent need intensifies for us, as we have nothing left and are unable to secure our basic needs such as food, water, and safe shelter. Here is our story - On October 7th, our lives changed forever, my family and I evacuated from northern Gaza to southern Gaza, hoping to return soon, but it wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u00a0Our home was surrounded, burned, and then completely destroyed, Our home, once a fortress of hope, now lay in ruins, a stark reminder of our shattered dreams. The night before we left from the north to the south was terrifying. Shelling sounds were everywhere, making a loud noise that felt like it went through our souls. Every\u00a0explosions shook the ground like earthquakes, sending shockwaves of fear through our trembling bodies. filling us with fear. The air smelled of destruction and blood, making it hard to breathe. When dawn came, we saw the devastation around us, realizing our home was now a symbol of loss and despair. We ran into the streets and with each step we took into the unknown streets, we felt as if we were plunging deeper into the abyss of our shattered existence, leaving behind everything we own in our home: Clothes, important official documents, the car, and literally it\u2019s almost everything - the enormity of our loss weighed heavily upon us. Our home it was where we found hope, safety, and made precious memories. Losing it felt like losing years of our lives, leaving us adrift amidst the wreckage of our shattered existence. A brief video depicting the devastation that struck our home and our entire neighborhood in Gaza. Desperate Plea: Escaping Gaza\u2019s Allergy Nightmare I, Haya, suffer from severe allergy to penicillin-derived medications, and my sister, Amal, also suffers from severe allergies to medications from my family such as Paracetamol and Ibuprofen. These allergies create a deep sense of fear and anxiety for us, as we live in a constant state of tension and fear of anything that may require a visit to the hospital.\u00a0We fear being given inappropriate medications due to the unavailability of suitable treatments in Gaza\u00a0because of war or lack of awareness and not informing the doctor of our allergies, which could lead to serious consequences threatening our lives. MY Father Income Our dreams are heading towards oblivion in the labyrinth of an uncertain future My story, along with my siblings, represents a united team of four individuals, three of whom are skilled programmers and one graphic designer. We work as freelancers in the world of freelancing. As for my younger sister, she is a student studying at the College of Architecture. She has always carried a big dream in her heart, a dream of being part of changing Gaza, of making it more beautiful and better.\u00a0She looked forward to the day when she would receive her degree and start building this dream.\u00a0But the beginning of the war changed everything. The destruction of infrastructure and universities cast shadows of despair over her dreams. When I think of my brother in Belgium, I can\u2019t help but feel deep sadness. He has been suffering from unbearable anxiety and insomnia since the outbreak of the war.\u00a0Sleep eludes him at night, and his physical and mental health collapses under the weight of these heavy burdens, negatively affecting his performance at work.\u00a0Problems and challenges pile up in front of him without the slightest opportunity for rest. We all feel psychological pressure and extreme anxiety. The war hasn\u2019t been limited to external attacks but has deeply infiltrated our daily lives.\u00a0We search among the rubble for a little safety and the basic resources for survival. Every day comes with a new challenge that we must overcome. As we sway amidst the rubble of shattered dreams, our souls wrestle and our hearts beat strongly challenging the ravages of war. Our parents earnestly seek a way to rescue us from this hell, feeling the heavy responsibility for every moment we spend under the shadows of fear and destruction. They dream of a safe place where they can build for us a better future, filled with security and hope, for\u00a0we deserve life in all its meanings of comfort and peace. Perhaps this fundraising campaign represents a light in the midst of darkness, it is indeed the only hope we cling to firmly. I appeal to the world as a whole to hear my cry and the mournful cry of my family in Gaza. We need the helping hand that reaches out to wipe our tears and build a bridge to safety. Your donation is not just a donation; it\u2019s an opportunity to rebuild life and brighten a better tomorrow. Be part of our hopeful story, for we need your hand to start anew.

        "url": "https://www.bbcworldinfo.com/2024/07/chatgpt-reveals-search-feature-in.html",
        "summary": "\u00a0 In an exciting development within the tech world, ChatGPT has unveiled a new search feature designed to challenge Google's dominance in online information retrieval. This new functionality aims to transform the way users interact with and access information, heralding a potential shift in the search engine landscape. The feature, announced earlier this week, integrates advanced AI capabilities into the search process, offering users a more intuitive and conversational experience. Unlike traditional search engines, which present a list of links and snippets in response to queries, this new search function leverages ChatGPT\u2019s natural language processing prowess to provide more nuanced, context-aware answers. At the heart of this innovation is ChatGPT's ability to understand and interpret user intent with greater precision. By engaging in a conversational manner, the search feature can clarify ambiguous queries, follow up with related questions, and tailor responses based on user preferences. For instance, if a user asks for information on \"the best ways to improve mental health,\" the system can delve deeper, offering personalized advice and resources rather than a mere list of articles. This approach contrasts sharply with traditional search engines, where users often have to sift through numerous results to find relevant information. The new feature aims to streamline this process, reducing the need for multiple searches and clicks. Instead of navigating through pages of search results, users can engage in a dynamic dialogue with the AI, receiving immediate, contextually rich answers. One of the standout aspects of this feature is its ability to handle complex queries and provide comprehensive responses. For example, if a user asks about the impact of climate change on agriculture, the AI can generate a detailed overview, incorporating recent research, statistics, and expert opinions. This level of detail and coherence is intended to enhance the user experience, making information retrieval more efficient and informative. Furthermore, the search feature incorporates real-time updates and continuous learning. As users interact with the system, it refines understanding and improves responses. This adaptive capability ensures that the information provided remains current and relevant, reflecting the latest developments and insights. The introduction of this search feature presents a direct challenge to Google's long-standing dominance in the search engine market. Google's algorithm has traditionally relied on ranking pages based on relevance and authority, often leading to a fragmented user experience. By contrast, ChatGPT's conversational approach seeks to offer a more integrated and user-friendly alternative. Industry experts anticipate that this new feature could have far-reaching implications for both users and search engine providers. For users, the promise of more accurate, contextually relevant information could significantly enhance the search experience, making it more aligned with individual needs and preferences. For search engine providers, the rise of conversational AI could spur innovation and competition, leading to further advancements in how information is accessed and presented.  As this new feature begins to roll out, it will be closely monitored to assess its impact on user behavior and market dynamics. Early reactions suggest that users are intrigued by the prospect of a more interactive and responsive search experience, and there is a growing expectation that this could represent a significant evolution in how we access and engage with information online. In summary, ChatGPT's new search feature represents a bold step forward in the realm of information retrieval, challenging the conventional paradigms established by giants like Google. By leveraging advanced AI to offer a more personalized and conversational search experience, this innovation has the potential to reshape the search landscape, promising a new era in how we find and interact with information.",

These interactions cover grandparent-grandchild interactions, teacher-student relationships, as well as community links across ages. The beneficial effects of these connections on the overall well-being of individuals cannot be overstated. \nOne of the key benefits of connections between generations is the passing down of wisdom from older adults to the younger ones. Grandparents, for example, often provide important guidance and knowledge for their grandchildren, passing down experiences, values, and traditions. This interaction builds a feeling of belonging and identity for the younger generation, providing them with a strong foundation for navigating life?s challenges. \nMoreover, intergenerational relationships help emotional health of individuals by giving emotional support beyond age groups. Older adults, through their life stories and resilience, offer understanding, empathy, and emotional support to young people with personal problems. In turn, younger people offer new ideas, energy, and purpose to the lives of older adults, reducing loneliness and isolation that can sometimes happen with aging. \nThese bonds also enhance mental health by creating opportunities for education, creativity, and self-improvement. For instance, older adults can teach their skills, hobbies, and wisdom with younger people, fostering a sense of curiosity and intellectual engagement. Conversely, youth often bring new technology, trends, and ideas to seniors, thereby promoting mental agility and adaptability. Such dynamic interactions add to the mental health of both generations. \nMore broadly, bonds between generations have significant societal implications.

        "summary": "In every corner of the globe, from bustling cities to serene rural areas, people are grappling with body image issues. These concerns transcend age, gender, and cultural boundaries, creating a pervasive challenge that affects millions. As society becomes increasingly visual and connected through social media, the pressure to meet often unattainable beauty standards intensifies. This article delves into the global phenomenon of body image dissatisfaction, exploring its causes, consequences, and the viable steps we can take to address this urgent issue. \nThe Rise of Body Image Concerns \nBody image issues are not a new phenomenon, yet their scope and impact are growing exponentially. The incessant exposure to idealized images of beauty through media platforms contributes significantly to widespread dissatisfaction among individuals regarding their physical appearance. Studies show that continuous exposure to such ideals can lead to negative body perception, regardless of one\u2019s cultural background or geographical location. \nThe Media\u2019s Mighty Influence \nThe role of the media in shaping perceptions cannot be overstated. From advertisements to film and television, and now more pervasively through social media, images dictating thinness and perfection flood our screens. These portrayals often present an unrealistic and narrow view of beauty, rarely reflecting the diversity seen in everyday life. The psychological impact is profound, as individuals of all ages internalize these ideals, which can lead to severe emotional and psychological distress. \nMental Health at Stake \nWomen struggle with soaring mental health issues, notably depression and anxiety, stemming largely from chronic body dissatisfaction. The relentless pursuit of an impossible standard not only diminishes self-esteem but also significantly impacts mental health. This issue, however, is not confined to women alone; men and children are also caught in this web of unrealistic expectations, often with less social or psychological support at their disposal. \nSocietal Standards and Self-Esteem \nThe societal benchmarks set for \u201cacceptable\u201d physical appearance are not only unrealistic but often unachievable for the average person. This discrepancy between reality and societal expectations can lead to a host of negative outcomes, including low self-esteem, eating disorders, and social isolation. The pursuit of these standards diverts attention from healthful living, encouraging risky behaviors aimed at rapid weight loss or muscle gain.",

        "url": "https://www.theedgesearch.com/2018/10/five-reasons-why-you-should-post-bail.html",
        "summary": "In most cases, when individuals are accused of felonies, a judge will set bail, and when the bond is posted, the defendant can stay home until their trial date. In many cases, posting bail is usually expensive for most people. However, if you cannot access any funds, a bail bonds agency can help you out at a fee. Here are reasons why you should pay your bail and get out of jail as you await your trial.Posting bail and getting out of jail until your trial has several significant advantages. Here are the main reasons why securing your release on bail is beneficial:   1. Better Preparation for DefensePrepare for trial.\u00a0You will have the right to meet your attorney when you are in jail. However, focusing on their trial preparations can be challenging when they are behind bars. When you are out of jail, you can efficiently devote adequate time to meeting the attorneys, finding witnesses and exploring different aspects of your trial. This will make it easy to face your trial more prepared compared to if you spent all that time behind bars.  According to a legal expert at the\u00a0Waltman law firm, working on your case for the trial will become a difficult affair if you are in jail. This will impede coordination with your criminal defence attorney and hurt your defence. Your lawyer might require several inputs that will help build a strong and successful defence. Posting bail and staying outside building the case is the sensible thing to do before the trial. This will help improve your chances of successfully defending yourself and walking out of the lawsuit with the best possible chances.\u00a0Access to Attorneys: Being out of jail allows you to meet with your attorney more frequently and easily, facilitating better communication and preparation for your case.Gathering Evidence: You can actively participate in gathering evidence, locating witnesses, and assisting in building a stronger defense strategy. 2. Maintaining Employment and Financial StabilityWhen you are faced with any felony charges and remanded in custody, you may miss work and eventually lose your job. Furthermore, people facing criminal charges should not miss out on their income. When you work with bail bond firms, you will have time to make proper arrangements at work. This is because you can notify your employer personally about the upcoming court appearances, and you can keep working until then.Job Security: Staying out of jail allows you to continue working, which is crucial for maintaining your job and avoiding financial hardship.Income Continuity: Continued employment ensures a steady income, which can be used to support your family, pay legal fees, and meet bail conditions. 3. Family and Personal ResponsibilitiesFamily Support: Being out of jail allows you to provide emotional and financial support to your family, which can be especially important if you are the primary caregiver or breadwinner.Childcare and Education: You can continue to care for your children and be involved in their lives, ensuring their well-being and stability. 4. Better Living ConditionsBe more comfortable.\u00a0Nobody wants to spend more time in jail when they have an opportunity to go out. When you post bail, you will have a chance of sleeping in your own bed at home. Additionally, you will spend time with your family and get to enjoy your freedom. Spending time at home with your loved ones will be more enjoyable and better than being locked up in the county jails.. Comfort and Health: Jail conditions can be harsh and uncomfortable. Being out on bail allows you to live in a more comfortable and healthier environment.Access to Healthcare: You can have better access to medical care and treatment for any health issues, which might be limited in jail. 5. Presumption of InnocencePlan your life after the trial. If you are worried that you may be found guilty and sentenced, then posting bail and temporarily getting out of jail can be essential. Based on the length of your sentence, you will have to name the person who will take care of your children, talk to your boss, rehome your pets, or even sublet your apartment. There are a lot of details that you will have to handle before you go to jail and serve your sentence. Dealing with all these issues from jail can be a nightmare, especially when you have no access to a cell phone.Upholding Rights: Posting bail reinforces the principle of being presumed innocent until proven guilty, allowing you to maintain your dignity and freedom during the legal process.Public Perception: Being out on bail can positively impact public perception, as you are not seen as someone already serving time, which can influence how you are viewed by the community and potential jurors. 6. Psychological Well-BeingMental Health: Jail can be a stressful and mentally taxing environment. Being out on bail can reduce stress and anxiety, helping you to maintain better mental health.Support Networks: Access to your support networks, including family, friends, and mental health professionals, is easier when you are not incarcerated. 7. Freedom to Pursue Daily ActivitiesEven when you are innocent, being accused of a felony can be embarrassing. When you stay in jail for a long time before trial, more people will notice that you are not attending your regular activities including social events, work, school pickup and many more. For you to be discrete about your felony charges and ordeal, you need to post bail and get out of jail as soon as possible.Personal Interests: You can continue to engage in hobbies, education, and other personal interests, contributing to a sense of normalcy and personal development.Community Involvement: Staying active in your community can help maintain your social connections and support systems. 8. Avoiding Jail-Related IssuesViolence and Abuse: Jails can be dangerous, with the risk of violence and abuse from other inmates or staff. Being out on bail helps you avoid these risks.Exposure to Criminal Elements: Prolonged exposure to hardened criminals and negative influences in jail can be detrimental. Being out on bail reduces this exposure. 9. Fulfilling Bail ConditionsPositive Behavior: Meeting bail conditions can demonstrate your commitment to following the law and the court\u2019s requirements, which may positively influence the judge's decisions in your case.Community Supervision: Complying with bail conditions can show that you are capable of being responsible and trustworthy outside of jail. ConclusionPosting bail and getting out of jail until your trial provides numerous benefits, from better legal preparation and maintaining employment to safeguarding your mental health and personal well-being. It allows you to uphold your presumption of innocence and actively participate in your defense, increasing the likelihood of a favorable outcome in your case.  Getting the right bail bond will do more than just keeping you out of jail until the trial. It can substantially have an impact on the next several years of your life. As we all know, sitting in prison is not enjoyable or fun. It is without a doubt that posting bail and getting out of jail has lots of benefits.",

        "summary": "Intergenerational relationships Relationships between generations, which include interactions between people of various ages, are important in improving well-being across various generations. These interactions cover grandparent-grandchild interactions, teacher-student relationships, as well as community links across ages. The beneficial effects of these connections on the overall well-being of individuals cannot be overstated. \nOne of the key benefits of connections between generations is the passing down of wisdom from older adults to the younger ones. Grandparents, for example, often provide important guidance and knowledge for their grandchildren, passing down experiences, values, and traditions. This interaction builds a feeling of belonging and identity for the younger generation, providing them with a strong foundation for navigating life?s challenges. \nMoreover, intergenerational relationships help emotional health of individuals by giving emotional support beyond age groups. Older adults, through their life stories and resilience, offer understanding, empathy, and emotional support to young people with personal problems. In turn, younger people offer new ideas, energy, and purpose to the lives of older adults, reducing loneliness and isolation that can sometimes happen with aging. \nThese bonds also enhance mental health by creating opportunities for education, creativity, and self-improvement. For instance, older adults can teach their skills, hobbies, and wisdom with younger people, fostering a sense of curiosity and intellectual engagement. Conversely, youth often bring new technology, trends, and ideas to seniors, thereby promoting mental agility and adaptability. Such dynamic interactions add to the mental health of both generations. \nMore broadly, bonds between generations have significant societal implications. By bridging the gap between different age groups, these bonds encourage understanding and respect, thereby lowering age-related prejudice and stereotypes. Age-diverse connections also help pass on cultural heritage, traditions, and values, preserving collective wisdom and strengthening social bonds within communities. \nIn today\u2019s busy and tech-centric world, efforts to foster and promote connections between generations are increasingly important. As families spread out and social systems change, planned actions to promote age-diverse connections are key. Organizations, schools, and communities can play a pivotal role in creating platforms for intergenerational interaction, such as learning programs that involve all ages, community projects, and shared activities that encourage conversation and understanding. \nFurthermore, policies and initiatives that support communities with diverse ages and intergenerational homes can give solid support for creating important bonds between older and younger individuals. These shared living environments not only solve housing issues but also create environments where mutual support, companionship, and collaboration can flourish. \nIn conclusion, the role of intergenerational relationships in promoting well-being cannot be overstated. From the transfer of wisdom and knowledge to the emotional and cognitive benefits, these bonds enhance lives of all ages. By understanding the worth of these bonds and creating chances for interaction, we can build stronger, more cohesive communities and enhance well-being for everyone. The magic of intergenerational relationships lies in their ability to build connections, understanding, and strength, forming a network of shared experiences that uplifts and sustains each generation.",

(said the girl who still struggles to understand graphs to this day and actively REFUSED to do a sociology or psychology  or  business/commerce degree  or cross major/minor bc they ALL required stats lmao)   anyway, that\u2019s besides the point. the point is that that course was almost the same price as my advanced diploma. coming in at $17,500 i think, while my AD was 16.5k. so even if i\u2019d gone to do the uni prep course instead, i\u2019d\u2019ve started uni with a hefty asf hecs debt already, anyway, much like my AD gave me before i EVEN GOT INTO UNI.  but now through the uni, the new course that they would put you in for an arts degree if you don\u2019t meet the requirements is a diploma of arts/social sciences and humanities. this course costs basically 23k ($22,800). one of the entry stream options is open to a ATAR minimum of 30/minimum of 65% in 4 hsc subjetcs/70% in 3 subjects for recent high school finishers or probs if i went back to do another degree, they\u2019d go off my hsc marks and my atar (not that im actively looking at going back, obvs bc ive already got 65.5k of fucking hecs/vet fee help (from business college) that i still havent managed to make ANY headway on paying off at all). i juts like looking up the changing field of tertiary ed tbh.   like obvs it\u2019s not the uni fault that it\u2019s that expensive, since the previous liberal (rightwing/tory/repub) government here in aus purposely jacked up the prices of arts subjects and arts degrees, so EVERY arts subject is like 2.5k or more a semester. so an arts degree is now like 16k to 17k A YEAR (and so are commerce and law). but my point is, you\u2019re already lumping a low-marked student with a SIGNIFICANT debt with the 22.8k for a \u201cdiploma in arts etc\u201d\u2026 which ok can get you into the second year of a degree.   but STILL. if i did this route today as a graduating year 12 student\u2026. how likely would i be to stay with a 2 semester course costing 22k a year or a one sem course costing $11,250?? esp if my atar is 30 or lower. given mine was 38.25 and i BARELY got through uni by the skin of my teeth\u2026.. if i\u2019d gotten into uni with that in 2014, with the rest of my year group cohort. dude, i would\u2019ve dropped out. HELL, i nearly did anyway with my AD bc that was practically 3 years. and i eventually dropped out in postgrad (although never formally) bc i burnt out and stressed out over my EVER-MOUNTING student debt that my dad kept telling me to ignore. just wild.  i think this is a large contributing factor besides the cost of degrees; as to why there\u2019s so many people dropping out of uni. like. funneling in very obviously under-achieving students (although sometimes through no fault of their own- ie mental health and for example, my battle with the board of studies to get a FUCKING LAPTOP\u2026. to NOT be classed a a \u201ccheater\u201d and \u201clazy\u201d and NOT classing my teachers, GP and 2 occupational therapists as liars on my behalf bc apparently the only perceived \u201cCORRECT WAY\u201d to sit the HSC is by hand writing it)\u2026.. are getting funneled into courses and dropping out..  bc of already incurring a massive nearly 22k debt JUST TO GET INTO uni. or maybe not- it\u2019s also high achieving students now as well (bc of degree costs)\u2026. but in general, HA students just get to walk straight in at the end of hign school (not counting if they\u2019ve already appllied for early entry). like obvs maybe many of these students actually end up flourishing bc they get to choose what to study and major in something they actually like\u2026.. as opposed to just choosing w/e the fuck their school had to offer (like me getting stuck with biology instead of drama or senior science\u2026. both subjects that the school i moved didnt have the resources for, for senior years). and the other subjects that are compulsory (english)/treated as compulsory by schools but were made optional by the government (maths) filling up their timetables and ruining their performance in the HSC.  but yeah. the debt is huge. and was huge in the first place already. but still. the way understandably apathetic, anxious and depressed students like myself for VERY OBVIOUS REASONS in year 12, are made to pay through the nose as opposed to more assiduous, studious, talented and successful students will ALWAYS grind my gears.",

        "summary": "Republicans are quietly pushing to defund transgender healthcare - and not just for minors   For a year and a half, GOP lawmakers have been stealthily adding amendements to government appropriations bills, which are key to funding major government departments, to ban any federal money being used for gender transition procedures. This will dramatically curtail trans people\u2019s access to medical care \u2014 just like the Hyde Amendment restricted abortion access, write Io Dodds and Eric Garcia.  3 days agoTHE INDEPENDENT Trans rights protesters gather outside the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City, March 2022 (Spenser Heaps/The Deseret News via AP)  Hundreds of thousands of transgender people could lose access to medical treatment or be forced to detransition under a little-known Republican effort to defund trans healthcare for both adults and children.  Since Republicans took control of the House of Representatives last January, GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill have quietly added a wave of amendments to \"must-pass\" government funding bills that would ban federal money from being used for gender transition procedures such as hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery.   These riders vary widely in their scope and effect. Some target government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Others would revoke insurance coverage for transgender government employees. Still others would bar federal funding for any institution that \"promotes transgenderism\".    Taken together, though, they would drastically curtail trans people\u2019s access to medical care that advocates routinely describe as critical to their flourishing \u2013 much as the 1977 Hyde Amendment restricted abortion access in the wake of Roe v Wade.  \"I remember a time when my own medical transition was the only thing going right in my life, and to have it taken away from me would have been existential at least,\" says Gillian Branstetter, a communications strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)\u2019s LGBTQ and HIV Project. \"This healthcare saved my life and the lives of trans people I know and love.\"  To be clear, GOP lawmakers aren\u2019t seeking to limit these procedures for everyone. The proposed restrictions would only apply when they are done as part of a medical transition, and not when they are given to cisgender (or non-trans) people to treat other conditions.  And while such riders currently have little hope of passing a Democratic Senate and presidency, they are a preview of what could happen if the GOP wins back power this November \u2014 and Republican lawmakers tell The Independent that is exactly the plan.  \"Certainly, I\u2019d be hopeful that they would go through [if Trump wins] \u2013 that we would stop taxpayers\u2019 dollars being used for things that taxpayers in Montana don\u2019t support,\" said Montana Republican Matt Rosendale, who authored a House amendment banning US military personnel and their families from receiving transition care through their Pentagon health insurance.  That change will affect a lot of service members. Trans people are two to five times more likely to serve in the US military than cis people, and the military is widely believed to be the country\u2019s biggest employer of trans people.  Independent senator Joe Manchin, who bizarrely claimed not to know whether he\u2019d voted to restrict trans healthcare, talks with reporters on July 11, 2024(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr)  Asked by The Independent whether he was concerned about interrupting people\u2019s healthcare, Rosendale said: \"I don\u2019t think that taxpayers\u2019  dollars should be used for surgeries that change the physical appearance.\"   Indeed, last week the Republican National Committee officially made cutting off taxpayer funding for all \"sex change surgeries\" part of its 2024 policy platform.  Other legislators were more diffident. \"Yeah? So?\" said Maryland Republican Andy Harris, a medical doctor on the House appropriations committee who backed several anti-trans amendments, when buttonholed by The Independent on the Capitol steps on Thursday before Congress left for recess.  Pressed on why he supported those amendments, he said: \"Because there should be no special rights.\"  Meanwhile, West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, who recently left the Democratic Party to become an independent, bizarrely claimed to be unaware that he had voted for a similar pair of amendments \u2013 only for his office to reverse course within 24 hours and say he did support them.  Trans people and their allies, however, do not feel so blas\u00e9.  \"Losing this crucial access to gender affirming care would be devastating to our community,\" says Ash Orr of Advocates for Transgender Equality (A4TE), a Washington DC non-profit.  \"It is not hyperbole that passing federal legislation to ban transgender healthcare, just like with abortions, would lead to unnecessary deaths.\" How routine funding bills have become a battleground  There is a broad consensus among medical researchers that gender transition is effective, and frequently necessary, in treating gender dysphoria. What exactly that involves is different from person to person.  The most common treatment is hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which masculinizes or feminizes the body over a span of months and years. Many trans people also find that it brings about a holistic improvement in their wellbeing and self-esteem. Though relatively cheap, it must be taken continuously throughout one\u2019s life, and stopping it will reverse some (though not all) of its effects.  Some trans people also get surgeries to alleviate their dysphoria, such as genital reconstruction, breast removal and augmentation, or orchiectomy (ie, testicle removal). These are more permanent, but far more expensive, and often have a long recovery period.  Such procedures aren\u2019t exclusive to trans people. Cis women take HRT to mitigate side effects of menopause, or even acne; children receive puberty blockers to prevent premature sexual development; and intersex people undergo genital reconstructive surgery, frequently without their consent in early childhood.  Menopause can wreck havoc on hormones, so many cis women take HRT to better control their symptoms (Getty Images)  Those instances, however, are not what GOP lawmakers are taking aim at. Their objection is to taxpayer funding of gender transition specifically, and the centerpiece of their efforts is  a highly bureaucratic but incredibly consequential process known as appropriations.  Every year, Congress must pass 12 spending bills to keep the government open by \"appropriating\" money from the US treasury. Each bill funds a different cluster of federal agencies, such as the State Department or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Traditionally this process has been relatively non-partisan. However, the must-pass nature of these bills creates an opportunity for members to force the spotlight onto their pet issues, proposing amendments that would get little traction in a standalone vote. Republicans have made gender-affirming care one of those issues.  Last year seven out of 12 appropriations bills were amended in the House to restrict trans healthcare, according to a report by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) \u2013 part of a raft of anti-LGBT+ additions ranging from bans on flying Pride flags above federal properties and blocking the enforcement of non-discrimination laws.  This year similar riders were stealthily attached to bills appropriating funds for the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Defence (DoD), and HHS.  That last bill is particularly important because it funds Medicare, which provides health insurance to around 65m older and disabled people, and Medicaid, which does the same for roughly 85m on low incomes.  In June, House Republicans amended this year\u2019s iteration of the annual National Defence Authorization Act (NDAA) to revoke coverage for trans healthcare under the Pentagon\u2019s sprawling Tricare health insurance program, which serves around 9.6m current and former service members and dependents. The Senate version of the NDAA was also amended to ban the DoD from paying for trans surgeries.  All this legislation dovetails an ongoing nationwide campaign to ban transition healthcare for under-18s and impose criminal sanctions on doctors who perform it, at both the local and federal level.   \"These anti-trans riders don\u2019t just target healthcare for trans youth, but adults of any age,\" says Orr. \"[That] indicates what we already knew: the battle over our bodily autonomy does not come from a concern for the safety of adolescents, but from opposition to self-determination and bodily autonomy.\"  'Losing this healthcare is an existential threat'  How would such laws actually impact trans life in America?  According to the Williams Institute, an LGBT+ research non-profit based in Los Angeles, there were around 164,000 trans adults enrolled in Medicaid plans that covered transition care as of 2022.  The 2015 US US Transgender Survey (USTS) also found that around 7.8 per cent of trans adults had health insurance through Medicare, Tricare, another military scheme, or the US Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs, as well as up to 0.9 per cent insured by the Indian Health Service. With an estimated US transgender population of 1.6m, that would amount to roughly another 125,000 to 141,000 people.  Not every person counted in these numbers would necessarily seek medical transition. On the other hand, they do not include the unknown number of trans people who bought federally-subsidized coverage through a health insurance marketplace \u2013 which could also be affected by some riders, according to A4TE \u2013 or who work for the federal government and get insurance from their employer.  Many individual hospitals and health systems across the country also receive federal aid. While in theory they could ring-fence this money to keep it away from transition care, some might simply stop offering such procedures \u2013 just as several major hospitals in red states have already done for minors.  For some affected trans people, this would mean a scramble to find some other way of getting medical care, potentially at considerable personal or financial cost. For others it would mean treatments being delayed or blocked entirely.  Those denied surgery might have to live with bodily features that make them miserable, while those compelled to stop HRT would undergo an involuntary medical transition \u2013 or even, if they no longer had the ability to produce their own hormones, a forced menopause.  Swimmer Schuyler Bailar as a NYC Pride Grand Marshal during the 2022 parade\u00a0(Getty Images)  \"Gender-affirming care serves as the foundation for the lives that trans people lead,\" Branstetter says. \"It gives us the freedom to be ourselves and to build our own futures... \"If you deny that to them, or you pull it away, that leaves them with very little hope and very little ability to continue to move through the world. And that\u2019s one reason why we have this notoriously high suicide rate.\"  Dr Jack Turban, director of the University of California San Francisco\u2019s gender psychiatry program, and the author of Free to Be: Understanding Kids & Gender Identity, likewise says that denying transition care would cause \"a substantial adverse public mental health impact.\"  That damage, Branstetter argues, would compound the deep discrimination that trans people already face in housing, employment, and other areas of life. As with the Hyde Amendment, it would also fall disproportionately on trans people of color and those in poverty, who are more likely to be on Medicaid and have fewer resources to pursue alternatives.  These bills aren\u2019t happening in isolation. In addition to the GOP\u2019s broad-spectrum war against trans rights and healthcare, the Heritage Foundation \u2013 an influential hyperconservative think tank \u2013 has proposed sweeping efforts to push trans people out of public life as part of its ambitious \u2018Project 2025\u2019 manifesto.  Hence, if next year\u2019s session of Congress opens with Republicans in control of all three branches of government, both Branstetter and Turban fear that withholding taxpayer dollars will only be the beginning.   \"Anti-trans politicians have been working to identify more and more creative ways to restrict access to care for transgender patients,\" says Turban.  \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to think that will stop, and this next election will have a dramatic impact on transgender Americans and their ability to access gender-affirming medical care.\"      \u00a0",

        "summary": "The new legislation significantly updates a decades-old law to safeguard children\u2019s safety on the internet. \n\nThe Senate has cleared procedural hurdles for two bills that protect children\u2019s safety and privacy online, readying them for a floor vote with a guaranteed passage next Tuesday. \nThe new legislation significantly updates a decades-old law to safeguard children\u2019s safety on the internet. The rules for the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) became effective in 2000, four years before Facebook was created.\n\u201cToday, the Senate takes a groundbreaking step towards ensuring our kids\u2019 online safety, a.k.a. social media,\u201d said Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who has been instrumental in pushing the bills to a floor vote before the summer recess. \n\u201cThe bills will provide the appropriate guardrails necessary to protect kids against online threats. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say these bills will be the most important updates in decades to federal laws that protect kids on the Internet. And it\u2019s a very good first step,\u201d he added. \nOne of the bills, COPPA 2.0, expands the age limit for protected minors from 13 to 16. It also requires social media platforms to obtain consent from users 13 to 16 before collecting their personal information and bans advertising targeting children and teens.\nThe other bill, known as the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), requires social media companies to take measures to prevent the spread of harmful content related to suicide, eating disorders, bullying, and drugs.\nSpecifically, KOSA addresses tech companies\u2019 algorithms for keeping users consuming content. It requires tech companies to allow minors to limit the category of recommendations or opt out of personalized recommendation systems that facilitate infinite scrolling. \nSen. Rand Paul (R-K.Y.), the only one who voted \u201cno\u201d to advance the bills, objected to KOSA, citing that the bill was too broad and that it would create a Kids Online Safety Council that he considered as \u201cspeech police.\u201d He said KOSA would cause \u201cfear of liability, fear of lawsuits\u201d and lead to self-censorship by social media platforms, which in turn, would stifle freedom of speech.",

        "summary": "Intergenerational relationships Relationships between generations, which include interactions between people of various ages, are important in improving well-being across various generations. These interactions cover grandparent-grandchild interactions, teacher-student relationships, as well as community links across ages. The beneficial effects of these connections on the overall well-being of individuals cannot be overstated. \nOne of the key benefits of connections between generations is the passing down of wisdom from older adults to the younger ones. Grandparents, for example, often provide important guidance and knowledge for their grandchildren, passing down experiences, values, and traditions. This interaction builds a feeling of belonging and identity for the younger generation, providing them with a strong foundation for navigating life?s challenges. \nMoreover, intergenerational relationships help emotional health of individuals by giving emotional support beyond age groups. Older adults, through their life stories and resilience, offer understanding, empathy, and emotional support to young people with personal problems. In turn, younger people offer new ideas, energy, and purpose to the lives of older adults, reducing loneliness and isolation that can sometimes happen with aging. \nThese bonds also enhance mental health by creating opportunities for education, creativity, and self-improvement. For instance, older adults can teach their skills, hobbies, and wisdom with younger people, fostering a sense of curiosity and intellectual engagement. Conversely, youth often bring new technology, trends, and ideas to seniors, thereby promoting mental agility and adaptability. Such dynamic interactions add to the mental health of both generations. \nMore broadly, bonds between generations have significant societal implications. By bridging the gap between different age groups, these bonds encourage understanding and respect, thereby lowering age-related prejudice and stereotypes. Age-diverse connections also help pass on cultural heritage, traditions, and values, preserving collective wisdom and strengthening social bonds within communities. \nIn today\u2019s busy and tech-centric world, efforts to foster and promote connections between generations are increasingly important. As families spread out and social systems change, planned actions to promote age-diverse connections are key. Organizations, schools, and communities can play a pivotal role in creating platforms for intergenerational interaction, such as learning programs that involve all ages, community projects, and shared activities that encourage conversation and understanding. \nFurthermore, policies and initiatives that support communities with diverse ages and intergenerational homes can give solid support for creating important bonds between older and younger individuals. These shared living environments not only solve housing issues but also create environments where mutual support, companionship, and collaboration can flourish. \nIn conclusion, the role of intergenerational relationships in promoting well-being cannot be overstated. From the transfer of wisdom and knowledge to the emotional and cognitive benefits, these bonds enhance lives of all ages. By understanding the worth of these bonds and creating chances for interaction, we can build stronger, more cohesive communities and enhance well-being for everyone. The magic of intergenerational relationships lies in their ability to build connections, understanding, and strength, forming a network of shared experiences that uplifts and sustains each generation.",

Even if two people have the same diagnosis, their symptoms, abilities, and likes can be very different. It\u2019s important to understand and adapt to these differences to give the best care. \nLet\u2019s look at some common areas where an 80 year old man with dementia might need special attention. \nMedical Care\nThe first and most important part of caring for an 80 year old man with dementia is medical care. Dementia can affect both physical health and cognitive abilities, so regular check-ups are crucial. \nManaging underlying health conditions is key. This may mean working with several doctors, specialists, and caregivers to create the best care plan. It\u2019s also important to stay updated on changes in medication or treatment as dementia progresses. \nPhysical Care\nAn 80 year old man with dementia may need help with daily tasks like grooming, bathing, and dressing. As dementia gets worse, these tasks can be harder for both him and his caregiver. \nSetting a routine and adjusting to his changing abilities is key to good care. Simple exercises and activities that suit his skills can also boost his health and function.",

Our team at Bored Panda has curated this list featuring some of the funniest cat pictures to ever grace the internet, all to make your day brighter, dear Pandas.

He explained that cat memes are beloved on the internet due to their overload of cuteness\u2026 however, that\u2019s just one of the many reasons they\u2019re popular. #4 Caught This Absolute Angel Begging For TreatsImage credits: reddit.com #5 ChompImage credits: Close up pictures of cats #6 Sweetest Tiny DreamsImage credits: Close up pictures of cats \"Cats are undeniably adorable, with their big eyes, playful antics, and fluffy fur,\" he told us earlier. Sington said that this adorableness and playfulness trigger positive emotions and awe in us whenever we look at cat content, whether we\u2019re looking at photos or giggling and aww\u2019ing at videos. Feline-related content can go viral incredibly quickly because cats can behave unexpectedly. Furthermore, they\u2019re masters of clumsy antics. #7 Catflix And ChillImage credits: reddit.com #8 My Crush Just Told Me Over Text That It Was \"Unmanly\" For Men To Have A Cat. I Sent Her This#9 I Have A QuestionImage credits: reddit.com \"Their independent personalities often lead to unintentionally funny situations that we can't help but chuckle at. They can be grumpy, sassy, and independent, or cuddly and affectionate. We see ourselves or our moods reflected in these furry internet stars,\" the pop culture expert told Bored Panda that we, human beings, relate to cat behavior and expressions a ton. #10 Picture Perfect Image credits: Close up pictures of cats #11 Halloween Costume Sorted#12 The Committee Against Vacuum CleanersImage credits: reddit.com Meanwhile, a huge upside of looking at cat photos and memes is that it can lower our blood pressure and reduce our stress hormones, which is a big win for our physical and mental health. Of course, the same goes for other animal-related content. \"In a fast-paced world, a quick cat meme break can be a great way to boost our mood and improve our mental well-being,\u201d Sington said. #13 She Is Beauty, She Is Grace Image credits: Close up pictures of cats #14 Getting Head Is BestImage credits: reddit.com #15 I Found This Little Boy In The Countryside, Alone. Initially He Was Scared, Now He Seems To Be Pretty ComfortableImage credits: Aritmico According to the pop culture expert, there will likely never come a moment when the internet grows out of cat memes and content. He thinks that it\u2019s a love affair that will most assuredly stand the test of time. For Sington, cats are inherently meme-able. \u201cTheir goofy antics and cuteness provide endless source material,\" he said. \u201cThe format is endlessly adaptable. Cat memes can be funny, heartwarming, relatable, or even savage.\" #16 Hi!Image credits: reddit.com #17 Perfect Loaf Doesn't Exi....Image credits: Close up pictures of cats #18 Love All RoundImage credits: Close up pictures of cats Cat memes are already deeply entrenched in many of our lives already, and they\u2019re not going anywhere. They\u2019re a much-cherished part of internet history. \"They\u2019re a reminder of the simple pleasures of online humor and the enduring fascination with our feline companions,\u201d pop culture expert Sington told us during an interview. #19 It's Joke?Image credits: reddit.com #20 Are We A Joke To You?Image credits: bloggy75 #21 Meow_irlImage credits: theproestdwarf Around 1 billion cats live around the world, according to the World Population Review. This means that you get 1 feline per roughly 8 people living on Planet Earth. Globally, there are roughly 350 million indoor pet cats, 480 million strays, and roughly 100 million wild cats, ranging from cougars to lions. #22 A Girl Teaching Her Cat How To WriteImage credits: usernot_found #23 New Species UnlockedImage credits: Close up pictures of cats #24 \"Describe Your Cat In One Picture\"Image credits: reddit.com It\u2019s estimated that around 74 million cats (a mix of pets, strays, and wild animals) live in the United States, making it (probably) the most feline-friendly country in the world. China is also a big fan of these animals. Roughly 53.1 million cats live there. Meanwhile, you\u2019ll find around 15.2 million cats in Germany, 14.9 million in France, and 12 million in the United Kingdom. #25 BlepImage credits: Close up pictures of cats #26 Bzz Bzz Mother-Bee'erImage credits: Close up pictures of cats #27 This Could\u2019ve Been An EmailImage credits: twcuddleston Which of these cat pics did you enjoy the most, dear Pandas?

I came across the series on Tumblr in 2017 and decided to give it a watch. It was right after Accepting Anxiety part 1. It\u2019s so creative and original I was instantly hooked! The fandom was something truly special. As a lonely, closeted bisexual and neurodivergent 17 year old with no friends and in a world that seemingly had no place for me, I\u2019d never experienced such unconditional acceptance and belonging. I made so many new friends and became so popular! My life did a complete 180\u00b0. I\u2019m 24 now. I recently picked up the series again after going through another rough patch and it\u2019s incredible how much these characters, and Thomas himself, mean to me and never fail to make me smile and laugh out loud, and encourage me to have a more positive outlook on my mental health. I just wanted to say I can\u2019t thank you enough for creating a safe space where I could truly be myself and offering healthy entertainment when I needed it most twice. You\u2019re the best!

Ffs its not lying if its to employers or cops and look up ur rights on what they can and cannot ask u many places ban asking about ur record and transportation status and things like that resources will also tell u how they reword sketchy questions so ur prepared \nHey. Take it from a former HR person\u2026 this goes double right now.  I just spent some time putting in some job applications myself (not for HR, lol) and got about 15 interviews. And idk if it\u2019s because of COVID uncertainty or if places just don\u2019t fucking care anymore because they know people are desperate for work, but the amount of straight up illegal shit\u00a0my interviewers asked me was appalling.  (That\u2019s not even counting the questions that were technically\u00a0legal but clearly fishing for information they\u2019re not legally allowed to ask.) A tame example? Two questions into a phone interview, the guy on the other end of the line asked:\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  I said\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d - giving him a chance to rethink that.  He didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  \u201cSir, you are not allowed to ask me that question.\u201d  \u201cWell, I want to know. I\u2019m asking.\u201d  \u201cAnd you\u2019re legally not allowed to ask me that. I\u2019m not required to tell you my age.\u201d  At that point, I guess he managed to remember an old HR bulletin or something (I hope to god he wasn\u2019t actually HR himself), and he said,\u00a0\u201cWell, I need to know if you\u2019re over the age of 18.\u201d (Which is what he should have asked in the first place\u2026 or not, since that was in the application that he could have read.)  \u201cYes. I\u2019m over the age of 18.\u201d\u00a0  And we moved on. Two questions later, he tried another illegal question. I called him on it again and ended the interview, citing that a workplace with such a clear disregard for the law, especially upon first contact with a potential employee, was not going to be a good fit. (They offered me the job anyway, lol. I didn\u2019t send a thank-you or a response.) At a different interview, the majority of questions were\u00a0\u201cfishing\u201d questions - just looking for that info they\u2019re not actually allowed to ask. (This person was also either not really HR or an HR person who was exceptionally bad at their job.) I could tell they were getting frustrated when I dodged answering the personal stuff, and they actually got extremely\u00a0upset when I mentioned later in the interview (re: less relevant work experience) I had worked in HR. They were super flustered for the remainder of our time, and I watched them skip over questions on their sheet they had clearly planned on asking. They KNEW they were being sketchy and were counting on me not knowing anything about HR - or my rights - and so they got upset when I did.  These were super tame\u00a0examples. I\u2019m begging you, if you\u2019re job searching right now, PLEASE\u00a0know your rights. Please know what interviewers are allowed to ask.  Please don\u2019t volunteer information or elaborate more than you\u2019re required to about personal things. Save your words (and everyone\u2019s time) by elaborating why you\u2019re good for the position/what you can do.  I may create a resource list on this shit later but PLEASE PLEASE KNOW THIS STUFF BEFORE YOU TALK TO AN EMPLOYER. This goes for anywhere you\u2019re interviewing as well as your current employer. This also goes for HR. HR may be the person you go to when shitty stuff happens, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re your friend (or competent).  They don\u2019t need to know your age (beyond 16+, 18+, or 21+, depending on the job). They don\u2019t need to know your medical history. (For the love of god, do NOT answer the\u00a0\u201chave you been diagnosed with depression?\u201d question.) They don\u2019t need to know if you have kids or whatever. They don\u2019t need to know a LOT of those things that may appear on an application, including your veteran status, whether you\u2019re on/have been on unemployment, etc. They\u2019re not entitled to know specifics about your transportation (unless you\u2019re using that transportation for the job, like Uber/delivery drivers). Look this up for your state/the job\u2019s state.  Beware questions like\u00a0\u201cWhat year did you graduate?\u201d if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t put dates on your resume (I just put amount of time spent at employers, not dates of employment). They\u2019re fishing for your age. It\u2019s \u201cOh, you know, 100 years ago,\u201d if you feel comfortable making a joke, or\u00a0\u201cAbout [generic number, like 5 or 10] years ago\u201d if not.  Also beware things like the\u00a0\u201cWhat do you do in your free time?\u201d question, even if you already work there. This is not a friendly getting-to-know-you question. This is a basis for judgement. Not up to an invisible standard? They\u2019re going to be biased against you for pay raises, promotions, etc. Mention kids/lots of family/social engagements? That\u2019s a tick against you for not being the kind of person who lives to work (yes, it\u2019s gross and stupid). Mention lots of solitary things? Cool, that\u2019s their mental note to ask more from you because you\u2019re\u00a0\u201cnot doing anything anyway.\u201d By all means, be friendly with your coworkers/talk about shared interests if you want, but it is none\u00a0of your boss\u2019s business, and be aware what could get back to them.\u00a0  Don\u2019t. Tell. Employers. Shit.   \nWe wrote up a handy list of those illegal questions here: 10 Questions You Should Never Be Asked in a Job Interview\u00a0 \n\n\nHopefully people already know this by now, but I saw way too often back when I worked in retail. Don\u2019t add your coworkers or boss on social media. Yes, your coworkers too. You don\u2019t want to accidentally say something to them or have them see a post and mention it to your boss.

Couples that I\u2019ve perceived as locked in for life have shocked me with the news of an extremely messy break-up, and I personally am guilty of portraying a picture-perfect relationship to the world while being on the verge of a break-up every evening. \nBut as heartbreaking as ending a relationship can be, it\u2019s often for the best.

And keep reading to find a conversation with London Celebrity Therapist Nia Williams from Miss Date Doctor!#1She cheated on me. Multiple times. On her trip to Europe. Which she is still on. I saw the Facebook messages on the computer where she was still logged in. Then she lied when I called her on it. This all happened about 4 hours ago. I\u2019m at a bit of a loss... I was planning our engagement. I\u2019m glad it happened now I guess. Very rough though. Image credits: finalproject #2I moved across the world for him. He kept telling me \u201cone day I want to propose.\u201d Or \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to be my wife.\u201d That proposal never came, and I was having visa issues, so after a few years I gave up and moved back. Image credits: DoYouMindIfWe #3She wanted to go to Florida for the Disney college program. (She is a huuuge Disney nerd.) She was too scared she would lose me. I convinced her to do it because if she didn't, she would regret it forever and that no matter what happened I would still be here for her. 6 months and an engagement ring later she told me that while in Florida she realized she didn't love me like she thought she had. The ring is in a box in the back of a drawer in my dresser. Her worst fear came true. So did mine. Image credits: devildrugsguy420 To learn more about this topic, we reached out to London Celebrity Therapist\u00a0and Relationship Counselor Nia Williams\u00a0from Miss Date Doctor. Nia was kind enough to have a chat with Bored Panda and discuss why most people do not end up marrying the first person they thought they would spend their life with.  \"While some are fortunate to find their lifelong partner early on which such a blessing, it's common for many to experience at least one major heartbreak. This is a natural part of life's journey,\" the expert shared. \"Relationships, especially our first serious ones, often serve as profound learning experiences. They teach us about ourselves, our needs, and the dynamics of sharing our lives with another person and major heart break is almost inevitable for most people.\" #4My mom was dying. It was my last Thanksgiving with her. Without discussing it with me first, he had his mom buy him plane tickets to spend Thanksgiving with his parents, and asked if I wanted to go with him. No. I am not missing the last Thanksgiving I can ever spend with my mom. We will have our whole lives to spend Thanksgiving with your family after this. You\u2019re leaving me to face this one alone, or to abandon my mother on her last Thanksgiving?           It was suddenly very clear (being happy to cancel wedding plans to do it later, and many other things) that he didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with me, but wouldn\u2019t break up with me, because my mom was dying, and he was too nice a guy to dump his fianc\u00e9e who\u2019s mom was dying.           To his credit, we remained close friends, and he continued to be there as my best friend and emotional support through her death, and some months following. Although it was 8 years ago, we still chat/text a few times a year, and catch up on how our families are doing.             Edit: December 20^th, 2018. I just got a call telling me he died today. It was tragic; he was a kind person, and only 36. RIP, my friend.

Even for very small disagreements and even in public. That was the final straw. It was very f****d up feeling begging somebody to be with me all the time. It gave he huge insecurity issues.   That was on top of the fact she began to call me names and hit me a lot. It all started after we got engaged for some reason. Things were so perfect but as soon as she got that ring everything changed. Suddenly she what I mentioned along with calling me a loser, piece of s**t, and ugly a lot. Image credits: Anti_Social_ #6We had been dating for over 2 years, and engaged for about 6 months.  Then one night, she bit me twice. Then I slapped her once, and she called the cops.    We were drunk (of course) and got in to an argument about something stupid, and I wanted to let it all go until the morning, when we could talk about it when we were sober.  But she was doing that thing she had been doing for a while at that point...refusing to relent until she felt she won the argument.  I was going to sleep at her apartment that night, but when she wouldn't stop arguing, I decided to get up and leave.    As I was starting to put my pants on, she tackled me in a fit of rage.  Then she bit my arm hard...so much so that she drew blood (I still have the scar.) I squirmed away, but she grabbed my legs and then she bit me again, hard, this time on my a*s cheek.  (I still have that scar too, only it's bigger.)  The second bite she wouldn't let go...gnashing on my a*s like a dog with a chew toy.  So I grabbed her hair, and pulled, then slapped her.  She was SHOCKED that I would slap her.  SHOCKED.  She called the cops.  They showed up, saw all the blood and that I was the only one bleeding, then arrested her.  I was actually kind of surprised by that, but they were reasonable individuals.    I did not want to press charges.  I was done with her, and saw no need for them at that point. Turns out the town she lived in has a domestic violence law that compells the prosecutor to file charges without needing me to press charges.  She took a deal that put a misdeamenor on her record (vs. felony battery), and  a years probation.  About 6 weeks after this incident, I met the woman who is now my wife.  This November will be our 22nd wedding anniversary.  And in all that time, she has never bitten me, and I have never slapped her. Image credits: anon We also asked Nia if it's good for daters to experience a painful heartbreak at some point. \"While it may not feel so beneficial at the time, going through a significant break-up can be incredibly valuable,\" she shared. \"Such experiences often teach resilience, self-awareness, and the importance of setting healthy boundaries. They allow us to understand what we truly need in a partner and what we can offer in return.\" \"Through the pain, we learn to appreciate the qualities that matter most to us and recognize the importance of compatibility and mutual respect. There is no greater mirror on who we are and what we want than when we get into a relationship,\" Nia explained. \"I have personally seen so many of my clients become so much more emotionally intelligent after a brutal break up. Although painful, it can help us do better in future and know what we truly want from a partner.\" #7We moved in together too young, and tried to be adults too fast. I should\u2019ve known things were not going to work out when he tried to convince me to buy a house with him at 19. NINETEEN. (In Southern California. On two retail employees\u2019 wages. Like, WHAT?!?)  We were high school sweethearts. He was smart and ambitious. But he also loved to spend money, and worked insane hours to try to make up the deficit. After we moved in together, his work schedule changed so I was working morning shifts, and would literally pass him in the driveway as he left for his night shifts. There would be several days in a row where we wouldn\u2019t see each other, and when we did see each other we were too broke to do anything fun.   We went on a trip with his family after a big fight, where I begged him to not ask me to marry him. I told him I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt anymore, I was unhappy, he seemed unhappy. I wasn\u2019t stupid. I knew why he suddenly wanted to know my ring size. I hadn\u2019t been happy for months, and had become a workaholic to try to keep up with the expenses.  I wanted to see if the vacation would bring a spark back into our relationship, then maybe we could work ourselves back into normalcy.   He didn\u2019t listen, and asked me to marry him in front of his entire family and surrounded by strangers, hundreds of miles away from home. I was 21, and had no idea how to say no. Our engagement lasted 9 days, because that\u2019s all I could stomach while thinking about spending my life with someone I wasn\u2019t in love with.   I have no idea what he\u2019s up to now, but I\u2019ve found my soulmate so I\u2019m peachy keen. #8Tbh I\u2019m pretty sure he lost his mind.   He was constantly accusing me of cheating, going through my phone and emails, jumping down my throat if I ran late at work. Calling my work when he found something he felt was incriminating to berate me and threaten to throw me out.   He took texts and emails he found between me and another guy, whom I was dating during a 9 month period where we\u2019d broken up, and used that to berate me and call me a whore because even though we were BROKEN UP \u201cwe still meant something to each other and I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d  He was so cruel. He\u2019d put me down and make me cry, then mock me for it. Anytime I tried to defend myself he\u2019d tell me he was the only thing standing between me and standing in line at the Salvation Army and to be careful how I spoke to him.   I was on my knees at one point, begging and crying for him not to leave me. I loved that man like a senseless fool.   Everything kind of blew up when I went to the beach for a day with a friend and he basically accused me of slutting my way up and down the coast.   It was the proverbial straw that broke the camels back. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I had reached the event horizon for my tolerance of emotional manipulation and abuse.   Huge argument ensued, we broke up. I got home and he\u2019d already packed my s**t and I left right then.   I was homeless for a bit, but I had my dignity and self respect back. Image credits: charlottedhouse #9She was already married. We worked together at job you couldn't wear rings. She hid it very well. I was the other guy. Found out when I proposed and had to tell me shes married.   Edit: we worked as military aircraft mechanics. We were 'together' for about 9 months before I proposed. Image credits: anon The counselor also provided some advice for anyone going through a painful break-up of their own. \"Experiencing a major heartbreak is undeniably tough, and it's important to allow yourself to grieve. Here are a few pieces of advice for navigating this difficult time: allow yourself to feel,\" Nia says. \"It's okay to be sad, angry, or confused. These emotions are a natural part of the healing process.\" Next, the expert recommends seeking support. \"Lean on friends, family, or a therapist. Sharing your feelings with trusted individuals can provide comfort and perspective,\" she told Bored Panda.  #10He cheated. And got another woman pregnant. Then called me a few weeks later asking me to be the child's god mother, because he \"knows I'm really good with kids.\" ?. Image credits: kmmy89399 #11Wow, I can't believe how relevant this thread is to me right now. My dad just dropped me back off at my house from the hospital 45 minutes ago so this literally just happened.(His fiance was watching my son while he took me.)   The last 4 days, my fiance has decided to stay at her new coworkers house either overnight or until well in to the morning. I told her that's ridiculously not ok to do when your engaged, even though she claims it was just stress relief playing video games with a new guy friend. We also have a four month old son that I've been taking care of for the past four days she's been gone, and I've been very sick with what I thought was a stomach bug. Well this morning I fainted, and she insisted I just get some rest and maybe go to urgent care if I dont get better. Then I lost my ability to keep any liquids down and was insistent that she take me to the hospital then go home and take care of our son.    This was too much to ask though, as she'd already made plans to meet this guy again tonight. She walked to her work and left her family behind to go spend the night at his house. I told her that if she chooses to abandon her family to go spend time with another man, who I never accused her of cheating on me with despite the numerous red flags, than her family wont be waiting for her when she gets home. I involved someone in my family out of necessity, so my dad took me to the hospital and his fiance watched my son.   My Fiance's last text to me simply said \"I cant come home so I guess I just lose everything.\"  After multiple chest xrays and an abdomen CT, it turns out I'm not sick, but the stress caused by my relationship started causing massive problems throughout my body. Oh and apparently I have a kidney stone.   I know it was petty but when I got home I just sent her a picture of our son and told her that this was who she chose to give up on tonight.   *Edit: After reading a lot of these other posts, I'm realizing I should probably have left her much sooner. Image credits: Jeiku53 #12We had been dating for three years, constantly talked about getting married and what our life will be like. He went back into the military and wouldn\u2019t commit to having a long distance relationship with me. Because it would be \u201cway too distracting when he\u2019s in the field and I pop up on his mind\u201d and he didn\u2019t want to commit to a relationship while in the army. So we broke it off.   The real kicker is that a couple months after being away in another state, he started dating a new girl who apparently lives in the same state as me. So. Lol. Image credits: collapse-collide It's also recommended to focus on self-care. \"Engage in activities that nurture your well-being. Exercise, hobbies, and mindfulness practices can help you reconnect with yourself,\" Nia noted. \"Reflect and grow: Take time to understand what the relationship taught you. Use these insights to grow as an individual and better prepare for future relationships,\" the therapist continued. And finally, she urges those going through break-ups to stay hopeful. \"Remember that healing takes time, but you will get through this. Believe in the possibility of future happiness and love.\" #13Completly unable to manage money. Spent every dollar he came across on gaming & weed and constantly put off paying important bills. Wouldve dragged us both into bankruptcy if I wouldve stayed w him. Image credits: summerlovin2818 #14She was in love with my best friend. And they were both in denial about it. They were engaged a month after we broke up.  Edit: Answering questions. They both told me nothing physical happened and I believe them but they hung out a lot (which was pretty normal because we were all friends in high school) and I'm pretty sure they were already emotionally involved because she started to drift away (emotionally). They were both nice about it and asked if I'd be okay. I said yes because they seemed like they would be happy together and I cared about them both but I don't hang out with them all that much because as nice as I try to be about it I still feel betrayed. I still talk to my best friend every once in a while but it doesn't ever really get any deeper than the \"what are you up to these days?\" texts.  And for everyone commenting been there and me too: I'm truly sorry. I sincerely believe that there's someone for everyone. Whoever you lost wasn't that person. As they say in Meet the Robinsons: \"Keep moving forward.\". Image credits: Cptcrispo #15Found credit card statement on the floor once, just before a family holiday. \u00a3thousands in debt that he'd never told me about. I'd been paying the rent entirely by myself in a job I hated and I was too young and na\u00efve (23) to realise he wasn't an honest man. That was it.   edit: we still chat every now and again. We wanted different things in life, so the argument that followed was the straw that broke the camels back. My next partner (now husband) had a lot of debt from a failed business, but the difference was he was honest about it, so I didn't care. Money doesn't trump love, but honesty is the bedrock of any relationship. Image credits: anon \"It's important to remember that every relationship, even those that end in heartbreak, contributes to our personal growth and understanding of love. It's okay to mourn the loss but also recognize the strength and resilience you gain through these experiences,\" Nia added. \"You're not alone in your journey, and with time, the pain will subside, making way for new beginnings and opportunities for deeper connections. It is also important not to personalize or put yourself down,\" the therapist noted. \"Rejection happens, and heartbreak happens. Do not feel that this has decreased your value in any way. There are over 7 billion people in the world, and one is for you. Don't give up.\" #16I didnt want any kids and I wanted to be allowed to work. He wanted a housewife and a large family. I was willing to settle on a compromise: 2 kids and I still got to work. He left me for it because I wouldn't be exactly what he wanted. He married someone else later who did exactly what he wanted and he was miserable with her and was attempting to take a mutual friend as his mistress. I dodged a bullet.    Edit: for anyone curious I'm glad it ended this way. As much as I like other peoples kids with the amount I've changed since this relationship ended I'm glad I have none of my own. Kids are great but the older me is glad I dont have any. I would have left him and the kids eventually for various reasons and it's better it ended before either marraige or children happened. #17He was obsessed in making me look/speak better. He would control my food intake and make me exercise everyday. Whenever i was out with him i have to wear heels..dress well and he would point out what other girls were wearing and that i should try on. Putting make up is a must even when I'm on a plane.   I wasn't allow to speak other language aside from english and not allowed to watch dramas that is trash to him.  My last straw was him asking me to consider to get a boobs job when i lost so much weight from all the exercise/controlled diet. I realised i cannot live this way anymore and he will never be satisfied ever.   Even though I still love him but I was mentally drained and constantly felt that I was ugly and unworthy. Image credits: Cutestuff_ #18I was engaged to a guy I'd dated for 3 years and planning a destination wedding. He cheated with a mutual friend one night. His mom (who he lived with while we were apartment hunting) accidentally walked in on them in the middle of it while letting the dogs out. He didn't know his mom had seen, but his mom called me and told me what happened. He denied it when I confronted him which made it worse. Called off the wedding and broke up, etc.  Weirdly enough, he got married about 5 years later to someone else in the exact same destination wedding location/venue/package/colors I had always dreamed of and planned out for us. He must have kept my planning binder and just reused it or something.    Edit: whoa this blew up! Made a clarity edit because guy did not sleep with his mom. Answering some questions here:   1) Could his mom have been wrong/was it a plot to break you up?   No. He finally came clean after I said his mom had walked in on him and called me. And the mutual friend admitted it to me too when I confronted her. His mom was basically sobbing when she called me because she didn't want us to break up, but knew she should tell me. I'm actually sad about losing the mom so much more than my ex. She was awesome! Some other things were revealed about him later too like he lied about finishing his degree at university and had failed out instead. I dodged a big bullet for sure.  2) What happened to the mutual friend?  Well, she and I definitely stopped being friends. She wasn't even apologetic when I confronted her. She had also been in a relationship that she broke off. They ended up dating for a while after that which was a bit of a mess because my ex and I ran a large, well-known community together. The rumors of what happened got out, but I attempted to be civil about it for the sake of the community. They, however, parked in the front window of the weekly venue and made out for everyone to see as a way of announcing their relationship. Super classy.   3) What happened to me?   I ended up moving across the country a few months later, meeting the man who is now my awesome husband of 8 years, and we just had our first kid last year. I'm much happier with this outcome! Image credits: St3phiroth #19I've been engaged twice. First one ended after meeting my family for the first time, my fiance made fun of my brother, who is very intelligent but sometimes socially awkward, for half the ride home. I slept on it, then gave the ring back the next day. F**k that guy.  The second engagement, we dated for 3 years and got engaged after 2. The closer it got, the more he decided he wanted to have children immediately, wanted me to stay home with them, and then said, \"Knowing that, I'm wondering if it's worth it for you to continue grad school.\" (I was just starting my second year of my master's program) Buh-bye. #20After 4 years of relationship, her parents couldn't come into terms with my religion and caste, they completely opposed our marriage, the girl couldn't sacrifice her parents' relationship and so she sacrificed me for them. Welcome to 21st century  India. Image credits: marzneo #21She became very dependent on me. She didn't have many friends, nor any opportunities to go out and make any. She didn't have drive to do anything rather just sit at home and do nothing. No motivation to play any sports or get a job. This sabotaged my life as I'd always be spending time and money on her becuase she couldn't afford anything herself.  She ended being an emotional toll as she had mental issues and I thought leaving her would just make it worse. But I'm so glad I left. It lifted a weight off my shoulders and allowed me to achieve a lot more than I was when I was with her. #22After 2 years of constantly forgiving him for cheating on me, it wasn't until I needed to be hospitalized that I realized he didn't love me. When I needed him the most he told me, \"I'm sorry, I can't take you being in there. It makes me too sad. Call me when you get out.\" So when I did, I told him I just wanted to be friends, but I had nothing against him. Literally a day after I called him and told him that, he made FB official post dating some other girl lol  I'm married now and really happy in my relationship. I definitely dodged a bullet :). Image credits: wanderingcat72 #23The relationship died.  We had very different ideas of what life should be like. For example, he had said he'd break up with me if I didn't get a college education. He also gave me ultimatums (twice) about moving with him to a small town- both times. At the second time, I let him carry out the ultimatum. Image credits: JenovaCelestia #24I found out the guy was no longer working when I called to see why his paychecks hadn\u2019t come in. (I handled the finances for us, and he kept saying his boss would be sending it.) It turned out he quit, and instead of telling me, spent the next few weeks pretending to work. Instead he started going to strip clubs on what little money he had hoarded.  When I went to break it off with him, he punched his hand through the wall and lost his mind. By the time he finally calmed down, he had turned strangely morose. He looked at me and asked if we could have sex one last time.    My response : \u201cNo.\u201d  Him after a long pause, sifting through his pockets and holding out a dollar bill. : \u201cI\u2019ll pay you a dollar to sleep with me. It\u2019s all I have left.\u201d  Needless to say, he left with a dollar in his pocket and no final goodbye.   EDIT : I can\u2019t believe so many people read this! I honestly expected it to be passed over, so thank you all for taking the time and sharing your questions, comments, and well wishes. I\u2019m sad to say while this instance was odd, I have a few more relationship stories that were even crazier. >.<  Apparently, I know how to pick them. Hahahaha   For those that were concerned, the guy ended up doing alright. Anger management, lots of partying, and a few years passed before he found himself with a little one on the way. He\u2019s quite happy and enjoying his newest addition. :3. Image credits: ValNTine #25She cheated on me. Though, going through that made me learn a lot about myself and readjust my standards. So in an odd way, I'm thankful that happened. #26My high school boyfriend and I would for sure have gotten married if I'd stayed in the relationship. We were planning on it. Both going to college in the same city, etc. And we'd been really serious, two+ year relationship, really loved each other a lot. I say this now as someone in her thirties with several years of marriage under her belt--high school bf and I had a bona-fide relationship going.   A month before leaving for college, my family took our annual summer vacation trip to [stereotypical New England vacation destination]. Boyfriend came along, as he had for the past two summers. I don't know what changed, exactly, but at some point during the trip, a switch flipped. I realized that left to itself, our relationship would in fact continue through college, through grad school, boyfriend would become a lawyer, I would become a teacher, we'd move into a house in our hometown that our parents bought, boyfriend would go work for his dad's law firm, we'd have a few kids, buy a vacation house, run some 5ks or maybe 10ks as we got older and realized we needed to keep staying in shape... I don't know, I just saw the whole thing, and I wanted none of it. As sexy and awesome as I found my high school boyfriend, I knew that that's what he wanted--stay in hometown, live a life exactly like the one he grew up with. For whatever reason, it turned me off completely. I broke up with him over that vacation and spent the rest of summer vacation crying my eyes out because he took all our mutual friends with him. Nobody understood why we broke up. Least of all me, to be honest--I just knew that I had to end it, because if I waited it would get harder.   Over a decade later, time has proven me very right. Boyfriend took less than a year to start dating another girl from our high school class (one I had teased him about having a crush on when we dated in high school). They got engaged a week after I did to my current husband--he was still wearing a ring I'd gotten him for his 16th birthday in the engagement photos. They live in our hometown, just popped out a kid, post pictures on Facebook every summer with their vacation trips to [stereotypical New England vacation destination]. He's a lawyer, works for the law firm of a friend of his dad's. I assume they're living in a house their parents bought them in the town we're from. He's living the life he's always wanted to live.   Me? I taught for awhile, but then my husband, who grew up on a farm but wanted to be a scientist, got a research job in Cambridge, England, so I took the opportunity to go back to school to get a PhD in children's literature, which was my dream job before I even knew it was a job. We have no idea what country we're going to be living in in three years--could be back int he states, could be in the UK, could be somewhere else in Europe. All of our friends are similarly transient academics from all over the world. *This* is the life I wanted to live. I would be so unhappy if I'd stayed in the life I knew my high school boyfriend wanted. I have no idea how my 18 year old self knew it, but I'm sure glad I listened to that feeling in my gut.   Thank you for coming to my TED talk.  Lol but seriously if you made it this far good job, didn't expect to write a short essay on a Monday morning. #27She got black out drunk and slept with her work mate. Bullet dodged. #28She ran away with her girlfriend... #29I asked him what I meant to him and he answered \"Nothing.\". #30She ended her own life last October.  It'll have been a year since she died in six days.  Still breaks my heart. We were already engaged, but she was a very, very troubled woman.  E: I kinda just shot this post out because I was so certain nobody would notice, and I needed to vent. Been breaking down a lot now that I'm approaching the worst day in my life, but it's good to know y'all out there reached out like this. Thanks, everyone. #31She slept with my roommate and my other roommate and friends walked in on them mid doggy. #32He's an absolutely wonderful dude. He just thought I was a different person than I really am. He and I met during a very stressful point of my life, and he thought that if I quit doing all the things that made me \"me,\" like volunteering, being a workaholic, helping my family, I'd be perfect. In the end, when the crazy subsided, I landed a job that makes me the happiest ever, via the volunteering I was doing, and my family stabilized and isn't quite as crazy as before.   We're both married to other people now, and thanks to social media I can see that he chose well, and is super happy. I'm happy here, and honestly, I'm really grateful for the way it all worked out. Nothing wrong at all with him, and he deserves all the goodness in life he has. #33Because I was too immature, selfish, uncaring and so f*****g blind to it I thought some of it was her fault. #34As we grew, his charm dissipated. When I was 18/19, he didn't have a job so we could always be together. He was messy, bit so was I. He played video games day but it was fun!   At 27, I was working full time and getting my BA. He was still jobless. I worked my a*s off. He played video games. I cleaned the house. He didn't clean s**t. I grew up. He didn't. #35I think he cheated on me, I honestly thought I could get over cheating but as it was proven, I cant. I could never trust him again and there is no relationship witjout trust. He also took me for granted and I am not going to accept someone who is that comfortable with making me miserable. I really thought he was/is the love of my life tho. #36He was cheating on me with a swinger lady, with random girls from Snapchat and Plenty of Fish, and his on-and-off again married ex girlfriend... From when she was pregnant until her husband found out more than a year after she gave birth. He would also get angry at *me* like I was bad luck when there were random d**g tests (military) and he's just taken coke the night or two before with his buddies.  He got angry when I had enough screenshot proof to confront him, and from the tone of his replies, he would probably have been violent too if it wasn't an LDR.  I dodged a freight train and getting engaged to a fabulous man soon. :). #37There was a point I had asked her to move in with me. She said she wanted to, but she wanted to do it right (she lived in another state at the time) and she wanted to make sure she wouldn't be a burden on me and would have money to contribute and such while she looked for a job.   We got along very well, and for a brief period I did see her as someone I could marry.   However, she had some major mental issues to the point of it being flat out irrational. Everyone has their own issues, myself certainly included. But I'm always fighting, and doing what I can. This may mean some days my fight is to just take a shower, but it's something.   But for her...she practically revelled in defeat. Every day to her was hopeless and things she had complained about since the day we first spoke were still issues half a year later.   It took me a long time to realize how much her own negativity was bringing me down with her, and eventually every day I was trying to think of some sort of excuse to not talk that night. Eventually I told her she was a wonderful person (she was) but it just wasn't going to work for me.   It was truely a shame. We got along amazingly well, had lots of similar tastes in things, literally never had a fight or argument, etc... it was great. But when i realized that she wasn't going to change, i knew i had to change on my own. #38She thought I was her Superman savior. She had a few screws loose I realized. And I'd have been broke at this point in my life. And miserable. She was very attractive and the sex was amazing. But even that fades. #39I realized I was too young and that we had ignored some red flags.   Edit: financial immaturities and lies about how her last boyfriend affected her that built up over time. #40She would sit me down and calmly explain why I was doing things wrong. It felt like being lectured and I hated it.  She is a teacher. #41I asked her to get her laundry together so I could take it to the laundromat later.  She had a meltdown. #42From the other side of the coin, I was the dumped. But I can understand why. We were very much in love, very much besotted with each other. But I took that for granted and I did not work at our relationship. She was a very ambitious lady, not for money or power, but for self-improvement, and improving others lives. I was, and still am, a self loathing coward whose every action or inaction was motivated by fear. I had no ambitions other than spending my life with her. She moved to America, and I was to join her, but I crumbled without her. As the days turned into weeks and into months I still hadn\u2019t made any inroads to joining her. I didn\u2019t know how, it seemed so beyond me. I loved her with all my mind and heart and professed it daily but did not show it through action. She was, and I assume still is, an amazing woman, strong and brave and smart and funny. She left me in 2004 and it destroyed me, and though I confessed it felt out of the blue, it wasn\u2019t. I told her she broke my heart. She told me I had been breaking hers for a long time. She was right. I\u2019ve never really been able to move on. I\u2019m still the scared little boy who she knew would end up becoming the albatross around her shoulders. I\u2019m 42 now, unemployed, living between my sisters living room and my mums apartment, completely broken by anxiety and depression. She made the right choice because she was too amazing, too ambitious and willing to work at a relationship that I was not because I thought it was perfect. Never take love for granted, because the pain of losing it may fade, but it always lingers and never really dissolves. Last I heard she moved back home and went to law school. If I had to guess I would say she works for some organisation that helps people. But I can only guess as I stopped communicating with her. For her sake or mine I don\u2019t know. #43When I was about to propose, she read the situation and told me she was seeing someone else. It messed me up for a while but I appreciated her coming forward. We eventually became friends again.  She is now engaged to some nerdy theater actor who I know would make her happy (She's into theater), and I went on to dating an amazing girl who sacrificed everything to come live with me. #44Our relationship was 90/10. I would do everything. Take care of everything. Pay for everything. Always be the first one to message, or call or suggest plans.   She put hardly any effort into us at all and I know i deserve more than that. #45I asked him to marry me. He said no. #46She f****d 3 dudes her very first semester away at college.    Call me naive for thinking I\u2019d marry my highschool sweetheart but at 20 I believed it. #47I realised after 6 years that we weren't happy. The relationship had gone nowhere, he would rarely communicate, and I was getting needy due to neglect. One day something finally clicked in my head and I ended it. It was a mutual ending that went way too smoothly. The fact that it didn't seem to affect him made it a lot easier. But we're still friends and I'm happy I still have him in my life. #48His mother called me \"common\" TO MY FACE as in, common as muck because I'm not from a wealthy background and he didn't say a word to defend me.   His colleague obviously quite fancied him and instead of telling her to back off, it was always contensious because I was being \"crazy\". I never asked him to stop being friends with her - just to clarify he wasn't interested so she would stop making snide comments to me.   Final nail in the coffin was when I was struggling a lot with my mental health and he told me to \"get out of bed and get over it.\"   Instead of one dramatic event, I suppose these showed me what kind of guy he really was! #49I wanted to get out of the s****y town we lived in.. seriously everyone there just sits around and smokes weed, no one was going anywhere. So I left, moved states and I have never been happier! Went back 10 years later and everyone was still sitting around smoking weed and going nowhere. The only difference was they had their kids in that environment. #50I was in nursing school at the time he and I got together. I was in a transitionary period in my life where my career wasn\u2019t set, so I rationalized that it was okay that he worked a minimum wage job at 30 years old. After all, I wasn\u2019t sure where my life was headed either. A few years into our relationship, and we talked about marriage a lot. He was still working a low wage, dead end job but his 6th such job in two years, with no clear plan at all. Any such attempts to lead him into a well paying job was always met with negativity and dismissal. He could work overtime, though, at his pizza job.   He told me that he was going to save up money to buy me a ring. Instead, he bought a $2000 mountain bike that sat in our garage. He never worked out or enjoyed active things, so it was a purchase that didn\u2019t make sense. He never saved for my ring but still talked about marrying me. I hated going into my garage after that.   Fast forward a year later, and I\u2019m a nurse. He is working a new minimum wage job (his 8th in 3 years) and spending all of my money on things like gun parts, a clunker of a car he was going to \u201cfix up,\u201d and a ton of other hobby items that he never used and eventually sold for half its value. It came down to the fact that I knew I\u2019d have to support him and any kids we might have, which would be no easy feat with his reckless spending habits that put us in the red every month. It also didn\u2019t help that he refused to do household chores, and spent his free time playing video games while I hiked, kayaked and went out to social gatherings that he refused to go to. We grew apart.   I know my career growth had a lot to do with it, and I think that maybe I was too distracted during school to really see that we weren\u2019t right for each other. A month after we looked at rings together, with these tiny shards of diamonds he got from his father that he wanted to incorporate into a ring but were too small and old, I decided we were better as friends and called it quits. I still feel terrible about it because we had so much fun together! We simply weren\u2019t compatible enough to go long term.   I think the final nail in the coffin was when he told me he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to have kids anymore, and he knew that was a deal breaker for me, who desperately wants them.   We broke up 3 years ago. He now has a baby girl and seems happy. I\u2019m dating an amazing man I hope prioritizes me over a mountain bike. #51Couple reasons.  - The way we deal with problems (personal and interpersonal) is different. He likes to hash it out then and there, while I like to ~~ruminate~~ process for a few days while I form my thoughts on it. It makes it seem like he\u2019s confrontational and I\u2019m passive-aggressive, which began to wear on us. It was fine at the time, but we knew in ten years we wouldn\u2019t be able to stand one another. - He requires more physical contact and affection than I do. We tried to compromise, but it ended up that I felt trapped and he still felt neglected, so it was sad for both of us. - The dealbreaker: turns out I\u2019m gay. #52We weren't engaged or anything but I thought he would be the one I would be with till the very end. But then my dad died and he not once asked if I were okay or offered any kind of support. That's when I realised that we just don't have the same values where it matters so I broke up with him. We have remained really good friends though and still hang out sometimes. #53I was extremely young & in puppy love. A condition to me even dating him that he was no longer to use d***s. I knew he was d**g user previously and he had asked me out many times during that period. In which I declined, until he was clean and sober. Eventually he was so determined to have me, he got clean. Later on I found out once he got comfortable with our relationship he was using behind my back, amoung other things. He, for some unbeknown reason to me, told his entire family I was pregnant. I was not pregnant, never have been. I never lied to him about being pregnant either. Which turned my life upside down. It didn\u2019t end well, I broke it off. Now he\u2019s married with four kids. #54It got to a point where He wasn't working or going to school, and just totally lacked ambition. After all the support and trying to push him to do more, I was done.  Edit: You guys, I've never had a comment reach 1k, more or less 3k! So thank you so much for that. It's quite heart warming to see all the comments and reactions this brief description got. To answer a lot of questions I've seen, here it goes: He did tell me he had mild depression when we dated the first time, but he was on new  meds the second time. I did communicate my issues to him and try to help him. But after crying countless times and seeing no improvement, I couldn't keep doing this to myself. I think we'll always care about each other. In case you're wondering, currently we both are in relationships with other people. I'd like to think things did work out.  PS- My bf isn't thrilled that this subject got so much attention lol. Love you hun in case you're reading this #55Both of us were alcoholics.   I met him at age 22, he was 26. Love at first sight. It was immediately understood without even speaking of it that we were just going to be together now, and that was that for 2.5 years.   I have still never met someone I have loved entirely as much as I loved him. And when I broke things off with him, I honestly think a piece of my soul died. Because I have truly never been the same since.   My mom and dad were both alcoholics and it f****d up my childhood. I had a drinking problem myself that I didn\u2019t understand yet. My drinking increased when we began dating because it seemed so normal to indulge more with him. The more I drank, the more neurotic and needy I became. The more he drank, the more he just faded away from the world.   He always drank to the point of blacking out and I hated it. I would see his facial expression go kind of blank while we were out, and I\u2019d know he was blacked out, like, nothing there, dead behind the eyes. And I\u2019d wonder where the guy I loved was. I\u2019d tell him we needed to go home and he\u2019d brush it off and refuse. He had to close the bar down no matter what. He\u2019d just always get so f*****g hammered.   Seeing the man I loved really drunk would always trigger this really lonely and dark sadness inside me. I felt invisible like I did to my parents my whole childhood. And he drank like, everyday. He never slept at night so much as he actually just kind of passed out. I always felt like I was sleeping next to a ghost when he was passed out from drinking. I felt like I was dating him, the perfect person, and then also his twin, who had nothing to give and no life inside of him. It was just a shell of him. It broke my heart constantly.   After some time of cyclical arguments (usually while both of us were drunk) I started to realize he didn\u2019t feel like he had an issue, and I wasn\u2019t sure he would ever face it. I wanted to face my issues. I wanted a better life and better mental health. He was not in favor of making changes.   He had socialized with the same group of guys since he was 5, all of whom drank to blackouts regularly, and his dad was a big drinker. They were from a privileged, upper middle class kind of circle where binge drinking was just normal because they went to more expensive bars and only drank craft beers and whatnot. Idk how to explain it. But there was a disconnect there between us. There was no part of his life that didn\u2019t revolve around alcohol and I knew if I didn\u2019t get away from that lifestyle, I was going to end up miserable or maybe even dead.   I still fight for my sobriety every day. He just got married last month. I saw photos from the wedding, where he had a drink in his hand in every photo and the same blank, drunk expression I could never cope with. I wish him the best, and I still miss him everyday. I f*****g hate alcohol for all of the s**t in life that it absolutely destroys. #56We figured out that while we love each other, we don't like eachother as often as we used to. We were becoming less and less close (physically and emotionally) and even getting lost in our travel-adventures could only keep us together for so long. Oddly, she could be one of those sweetest most thoughtful people you'll ever meet, but could flip a switch at the silliest times. Real mind f**k.  Breaking it off (after 6 years) was one the most adult, and most painful things I've ever done in my life. I made 5 women cry that day, her, our moms and my sisters (I also cried like a girl.) I half-joke that I may end up just dying alone to avoid a mess like that again lol.  *editing my trash phone typing. #57She and I were both law students in our final semester. She had a job lined up at a first class law firm. At the time, I had interviewed with a bunch of judges for a clerkship, but had no offers yet. What I really wanted to do was join the Marines. I\u2019d been telling people that for a couple of years.  She came from a far wealthier and more materialistic family than I did. Just after NYE, she and her mother went to Paris for a shopping trip. They spent $10,000 just on the shopping. I grew up on a farm raised by back-to-the-land hippies who grew/hunted/gathered our food.  She had been dropping serious hints that we needed to get engaged SoonTM since before Christmas. It was nearly Valentines Day. Right before I went out to spend nearly my entire savings on a $12,000 engagement ring, my ex-almost-fianc\u00e9e (that\u2019s what I\u2019ve called her for the last 15 years) and I had a \u201cstate of the union\u201d conversation. One of those, what do you really want to do with your life conversations. During the course of this conversation, she informed me of a few things: 1. She didn\u2019t want me to join the Marines because she didn\u2019t want to follow me around. Fair enough, then I agreed to get another public service job. Maybe with the federal public defender or as a prosecutor. 2. I had to sell all my guns, because \u201conly rednecks own guns and even though I know you\u2019re not a redneck, people might think you were if they found out you owned guns.\u201d 3. \u201cIf we make less than $300,000 per year combined income, we might as well be living on food stamps.\u201d 4. \u201cWe can never live in the state of VA, because VA is a redneck state from top to bottom.\u201d Even Arlington? Yes, even Arlington.  After hearing all that, I decided we needed to take a break for a few days and think things over. Instead of going ring shopping, I drove down to my brother\u2019s house in VA for the weekend. I was stuck in horrendous traffic when I got a phone call from one of the judges with whom I had interviewed. Just like that, I had a great job lined up in the same city as her. While not great pay, it was a perfect step stone to a higher paying job. A few minutes later I was still stuck in traffic and I look over and there\u2019s a gun store. Five minutes later, I\u2019m still next to the gun store. So, I went inside and after much consideration, spent $300 on a beautiful .45. It was the first time I had treated myself to anything at all in over two years. I drove down to my little brother\u2019s house and discussed the situation with him. \u201cIn three years, you\u2019re still going to have this gun, but you won\u2019t be married to her.\u201d  I went back up to the city where we both lived and ran into her in the parking garage. I told her, \u201cI got a job in _______,\u201d and watched her face light up. \u201cAnd I bought a new gun.\u201d And watched her smile fade. I told her she had to love me for who I was. That I loved her, but I wasn\u2019t going to give up all the things I wanted, that we would need to compromise on some things. She wouldn\u2019t budge, so we split for good.   After a year working for that judge, I joined the Marines. Twelve years later, I don\u2019t regret how that situation turned out at all. I\u2019m now happily married and I\u2019m changing careers so I can spend more time with my wife and daughters. #58We had an intense attraction to each other but there were 2 reasons I had to walk away-- First is he was very jealous and controlling. I couldn't say hi to someone in passing without getting grilled about who he was, how I knew him, was I talking to him secretly, did I wish I was dating him, etc.   Second our ambitions didn't match up. I wanted more out of life than he did. I wanted the professional degree and he wanted to work on cars. There is nothing wrong with that at all but our paths to our preferred destinations took us in very different directions.    I still think if him and wonder but have been happily married for more than 25 years. #59Ohh super easy answer. Dude was a douche and hit me across the face. Also couldn't hold down a job, but you know, mostly the face thing. #60Doesn\u2019t really fit here because I did marry him in the end, but in retrospect I should have broken it off before it got that far.   He wasn\u2019t who I thought he was and I wasn\u2019t who he wanted me to be. He was depressed, obese and had huge self-worth issues and some trouble with alcohol abuse. The relationship ended up being more of a caretaker-patient thing with him making me feel guilty when I left home for work and spending spare time with someone else was unthinkable. Short term I figured he\u2019d get better, but he refused therapy. He tried starting 4 studies but lost interest sooner with each of them. With this getting progressively worse for 9 years in the end he had no diploma, no income, was heavier than ever, drinking daily and relying on me for everything.   Leaving was difficult, but it was the best thing I could have done for him. He finally started taking responsibility, started therapy and now he\u2019s financially independent, taking care of his body and doing all kinds of active things with friends. In the meantime I\u2019m happily taken and feel a lot more free to pursue my goals and dreams with a partner who\u2019s also aiming for the stars. #61When she became physically abusive and sexually inactive. #62We had been dating for two years, but had dated in high school 10 years before that. She had been married for a short time but that all broke up right before we started dating. Anyways, she wouldn\u2019t invite me around to her parents place ever, because they were very religious and didn\u2019t believe in divorce. After getting engaged, tho, I felt like I ought to \u201covary up\u201d and clear the water with them...I had known them in high school (though they had never liked me) and I remembered her dad\u2019s mobile number. So I called him. Long story short, she was still married to her husband. She had lied about getting divorced and I was her side chick, though she spent so much time with me, I don\u2019t believe they could have had a very happy marriage. I made her give me the ring back. #63We started dating in high school, and had the typical first love relationship. We moved to another state for college and he just completely changed. Well, I guess we both did in our own ways. I was bored in the relationship and he had no ambition whatsoever, unless it was just one of his music projects. He got kicked out of school twice and held a job only like a month the whole time I was in school. I was the only income for us until graduation. I worked two jobs during school on top of my clinical rotations. He always needed some knew piece of equipment. In my head I didn't realize I could leave the relationship. I finally had enough when I had a death in the family and decided I would go alone so he could take care of trying to get in school for the third time. He made it all about him, that he knew my family didn't like him and was demanding to know why they don't want him there. Not once asked how I was doing either. He bugged me the whole time I was trying to take care of my family too. My sister was talking to me about how she was deciding to leave her husband when it clicked.  I didn't have to stay with him even though we where engaged! When I returned home, I told him I would still help him get in school, but only as a friend. #641. I lost my father and get ignored me for a week bc I went out with my friends to distract myself.  2. Told me he\u2019d shoot his face off if I was ever happy with anyone but him. #65Ultimately his parents and his inability to step up to them and put his foot down as a grown man. #66Went back with him to visit his family in the UK for a month - I'm Chinese,  he's Scottish and found that he's an extremely selfish,  self centered spoiled brat and his family thinks he's an angel n expected me to bow to him as they all did. Worst of all,  he was never this way when we were dating here in my country where he's an expat,  but his true colors shone when he was back with his family.   Edit : what hurt me the most though,  was this - his dad was really nice to me because I think we both recognized that we were the same kind of people,  it was always the dad and I cleaning up after everyone else,  always us making coffee for the others,  always us setting the table and cooking. And one day when the dad came home from the grocers he proudly brought out two large containers of fresh strawberries that he bought for me. I mentioned that I love strawberries (they are very expensive in my country)  in some random conversation we had days ago,  it wasn't even a talking point or anything,  even I forgot I said it.   So I told my boyfriend during an argument that his dad is so thoughtful and how come he doesn't see it and my bf replied *'oh please. You haven't seen my dad's bad side,  he ain't such an angel'*.  Even if that is true,  why would you say that???",

        "summary": "Four NGOs are encouraging members of the public to object to development plans at Fort Chambray, particularly the demolition of the fort\u2019s barracks, as today is the last day in which people can submit their views to the Planning Authority. \nDin l-Art \u0126elwa G\u0127awdex, G\u0127awdix, Moviment Graffitti, and Wirt G\u0127awdex have harshly criticised the plans submitted by a group of developers who stepped in to revive an abandoned project that was handed to Gozitan businessman Michael Caruana, who owns Gozo\u2019s Hotel Calypso. \nThe original project, conceded through a parliamentary concession in the 1990s, has lain dormant for years. \n \nThe developers, on the other hand, say their intention is to add value to the site. The Shift spoke to the developers to address the concerns raised by NGOs. They said, \u201cThe plans form part of an already approved master plan for the site, whereby measures for the general public to be allowed access to the site and its enjoyment have been taken into consideration\u201d. \nIf approved, the new plans would develop some 4,500 square metres of new floor space not included in the original master plan. \nCalling for protection\nThe NGOs are calling for the protection of the fort, saying other forts in Malta, such as Mtarfa, Pembroke, and St George\u2019s, have protection status. \n\u201cFort Chambray\u2019s British barracks are unique in Gozo, and the only ones within a Knight\u2019s period fortification, making their lack of protection unacceptable,\u201d the NGOs said in a statement on Wednesday. \nThey have drawn attention to the planned demolition of Fort Chambray\u2019s Married Quarters British Barracks, which they say is one of Malta\u2019s oldest and only British barracks in Gozo.",

        "url": "https://retroworldnews.com/embracing-slow-dating-discover-the-benefits-of-mindful-connections/",
        "summary": "The slow dating trend is a growing movement that emphasizes taking a more deliberate, thoughtful, and mindful approach to dating. This trend contrasts with the fast-paced, swipe-driven culture of many modern dating apps, where decisions are often made quickly and based on superficial impressions. Slow dating decelerates us to the things that truly matter\u2014boiling down to fewer, more meaningful connections. The focus is on building deeper connections with fewer people, rather than casually dating hurriedly. \nWhat the Slow Dating Trend is All About\n \nOne of the main aspects of the slow dating trend is intentionality. Be selective and intentional about who you choose to date, prioritizing compatibility and shared values. It challenges you to be fully present during dates, paying attention to the person you are with and the quality of your interactions. Engage in meaningful conversations, small talks even, that go beyond surface-level topics, exploring each other\u2019s values, dreams, and life goals. \nIt also demands that you allow the relationship to develop naturally over time, rather than rushing through stages. This includes taking time to get to know each other before becoming exclusive or making long-term commitments. Invest time in building a strong emotional and intellectual foundation as this is preferable prior to physically advancing the relationship. \nIn addition, slow dating expects you to trust the process without the pressure to find \u201cthe one\u201d immediately. Enjoy the journey of getting to know someone. Create a dating environment that feels comfortable and low-pressure for both parties. Look for signs of long-term compatibility, rather than just short-term attraction. Also, consider factors like lifestyle compatibility, shared interests, and mutual respect, and remember that your core values and future goals should align with your dating partner. \nWhy People Admire the Slow Dating Trend\n \n\nMany people experience burnout from the fast-paced nature of modern dating, leading them to seek more fulfilling and less stressful alternatives.",

        "summary": "Enter the world of Pilates and reap the wellbeing benefits with these invaluable insights\nPilates is definitely a hot topic right now, with PureGym\u2019s global report on the top fitness trends for 2024 citing \u2018Wall Pilates\u2019 seeing a staggering 4,461% rise in searches. And, as exciting and tempting as it can be to get stuck in, it can often feel overwhelming starting anything new. \nBut, rest assured, you don\u2019t need to feel worried, Pilates is generally considered a slower workout with detailed cues, which not only helps you master the practice, but also provides an opportunity to find body awareness through more mindful movement. Most of us could do with a little less cortisol running through our bodies, so as much as the practice can be challenging, you should feel relaxed and grounded afterwards. \nReady to give it a try? Here are five top tips to help you get started. \n1. Find the Pilates teacher and class that suits you \u2013 and don\u2019t be afraid to switch.\nThere are many different styles of Pilates these days, so if one class doesn\u2019t suit you, there\u2019s nothing to stop you from trying another. The principles of the practice will still remain, but the style may vary. From classical to contemporary, to reformer and equipment, odds are something will click. \nThis is also true with choosing your teacher. The right teacher not only instructs, but also motivates and inspires. Pilates can be challenging, and having a supportive instructor can make a significant difference in your motivation levels. A good teacher creates a positive, encouraging environment that makes students feel comfortable pushing their limits and exploring new movements. A skilled teacher will also be able to modify moves to suit you and your body. \n2. Master the basics first\nStarting with fundamental movements is crucial in Pilates. Focus on learning key principles like proper alignment, engagement from the centre, and breathing properly. Understanding the basics will help you perform exercises more effectively and safely. It\u2019s important to find a certified teacher that you connect with, so you feel comfortable and confident. Ask questions after class, or even take private sessions, to ensure you\u2019re moving in the best way possible. \n3.",

Her hair was stiff and a light color Athena didn\u2019t recognize as over-bleached.

The television in the com,mon area played out of date Looney Toons and Hanna-Barbara, looping through copyright free eternity. Alice spent hours with construction paper and scissors and glue, her face working its expressions through the paper shapes. Athena liked watching her mouth, how she sometimes stuck her tongue in her teeth or frowned with concentration. Each scrap of paper went into her pockets. Athena smiled when Alice caught her staring and Alice smiled back, blushed.  After lights-out Alice spread red and pink and green paper rose petals over herself. Athena blushed and Alice grinned self consciously and Athena slipped into her bed, taking care with the alarms designed to warn staff in the event Alice was out of the bed without any forewarning. Athena felt along Alice\u2019s body, papery and silky scarring over her chest, soft legs with loose muscles. Her unblemished, deeper brown skin against Alice\u2019s pale olive tones formed a blasted landscape.  Alice\u2019s lips were chapped and rough against her stomach, and the cage around her shoulders was unexpectedly warm. The burn flickered and glowed between them. Alice ran metal fingers along Athena\u2019s broad thighs and gently stroked her calves and ankles. When Athena put her hand further down between Alice\u2019s legs, brushed a thumb along her flacid member, the other woman shook her head. \u201cMmm.\u201d Athena made a curious sound and Alice murmured, \u201cNothing\u2019s working down there. Please.\u201d She kissed Athena along the inside of her thighs. Athena spread them, ran her fingers through Alice\u2019s rough, thin hair.   \u201cAthena 6,\u201d murmured Alice, and Athena said, \u201cWhat?\u201d before remembering the tattoo. \u201cOh,\u201d Athena said. \u201cBunny,\u201d Alice smiled and kissed further up her thighs, then between, then pushed her lips and tongue close as Athena clenched her teeth to keep herself quiet. It wouldn\u2019t do any good to be overheard by some lone orderly doing the rounds. \u201cWitch,\u201d she hissed out to the sounds of Alice between her legs and the textured rubber grip of the metal hands around her rear.  Another few days later, Alice was able to sneak safety scissors back to the room, and snap the blades out of the plastic. She gouged a matching \u201cAlice 9\u201d into her own thighs and laughed in the orderlies\u2019 faces when the found her in a pool of her own blood. She peeled the bandages away nightly, and sometimes she and Athena would do little more than lay pressed up close in Alice\u2019s bed at night, tracing names along one another\u2019s skin.  \u201cI wish I could see the water and the light in your brain,\u201d Alice said.  \u201cYou slew dragons and sat out under the sun and the moon,\u201d Athena said.  \u201cYes and my father was a noble king and I lived in a castle ruled by an evil wizard who transformed me with a curse,\u201d she laughed and put her face to the crook of Athena\u2019s neck. \u201cAnd I will one day carry you up the stairs into the sun, but I wish I could share the grass and the gate and the peaceful lake with you.\u201d  \u201cI wish I could take us both away there,\u201d Athena said. \u201cI wish\u2026 everything I guess.\u201d She thumped her head on Alice\u2019s neck.

She wrenched her intubation and IVs out and dragged herself through the mess of wires and bleeting bed alarms to shove their door closed. \u201cQuick, how many kisses I can get before they get the door open.\u201d  Athena\u2019s laughter was a silent kind, held down and inside against the mere idea of being heard or seen, but Alice loved to find ways to bring it out of her a little at a time. \u201cAlice, what-\u201d Athena hurried over, smiling her rare smile.  \u201cNo time!\u201d Alice said, \u201cHurry!\u201d One of the orderlies was knocking and asking if everything was okay in there.  \u201cThey\u2019re gonna be so mad!\u201d  \u201cBetter get as many kisses in as you can, then.\u201d So Athena did.  Eventually several orderlies with a broom handle managed to open the door, muscling Alice back into bed. She was too exhausted to fight them on re-doing her feeding tube.  Athena stood by the bed when the last orderly had left. \u201cAlice\u2026 why. I lo\u2026 I love you, but why?\u201d  \u201cYou love me?\u201d  \u201cYeah. Of course.\u201d Athena took Alice\u2019s hand, and Alice pulled Athena\u2019s hand close and kissed it. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I love you.\u201d Athena nodded and squeezed. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing no one else gets to say,\u201d Alice said, \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you get to go out.\u201d She squeezed back and smiled.  \u201cI hate this bed, and I\u2019m not dying in it.\u201d Alice shook Athena\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cThey don\u2019t get that from me.\u201d  Her eyes were fierce and deep sunken and all the same Alice struggled more every day to pull herself out of the web of tubes and monitors, to lean in close to Athena, to sit up, kiss and speak. Her skull and scalp all outlined, she whispered \u201cthey stole my saws\u201d and that was the last thing she said to Athena. The bed she hated was where she left Athena behind, all her limbs still, cold, magnificent and unmoving.  That was where the memories of Alice came to their end. She wouldn\u2019t have memories of anything else, no matter how many times afterwards Athena would ask her own memories of Alice why she left, all the way up until Riverside closed under budget cuts for mental health care.",

From school children to senior citizens, everyone experiences stress during different phases. While some manage to extricate themselves from depression, others can\u2019t find a way out of it and resort to extreme\u00a0steps. By sharing your thoughts with your trusted friends or family members, you can de-stress in the right way. When you bury your feelings, you can\u2019t carry the weight of it and life becomes burdensome. When you confide in your problems with your confidants, then you can certainly derive solutions to the most niggling\u00a0issues. Venting your negative thoughts can be beneficial for your mental well-being. It really helps in detoxifying the mind. Don\u2019t shy away from discussing your mental health. The stigma surrounding mental health is slowly diminishing, with many celebrities and stars becoming vocal about their mental\u00a0illness. There may be a plethora of suggestions on how to deal with stress. Reading writing, cooking, baking, yoga, meditation, walking and the list goes on. Can you indulge yourself wholeheartedly in these activities, when you are emotionally flustered? Some even contemplate of fleeing to sequestered locations to avoid human interaction. They misconstrue the real meaning of \u2018mind relaxation\u2019. Living in solitude gives you scope for self-introspection and ample freedom. But on the flip side, loneliness only exacerbates stress. Photo by Andrew DesLauriers on\u00a0UnsplashHave you ever thought about how the less educated and underprivileged deal with their mental illness? Take, for instance, my maid Nancy, who found counsel in her neighbour. She confides in her any kind of problems. People like Nancy neither have financial resources to seek professional counselling nor do they have enough time to pursue various stress busting activities. Like caged birds struggling within its confines, a troubled mind needs liberation from pessimistic thoughts. When you let go of your emotions, you feel\u00a0calm. If you are in great mental distress, try reaching out to your family or friends. In-person meetings would be more beneficial than digital modes of communication. Nothing can be more healing than a warm hug from your loved ones. When you pour your heart into them, you can feel relieved to a great extent. I believe, this approach will certainly be more effective than psychological counselling. Photo by Dylan Sauerwein on\u00a0UnsplashThough researchers opine on the serious ramifications of venting out, yet it is really liberating for the mind and soul when you speak your\u00a0mind!

Ffs its not lying if its to employers or cops and look up ur rights on what they can and cannot ask u many places ban asking about ur record and transportation status and things like that resources will also tell u how they reword sketchy questions so ur prepared \nHey. Take it from a former HR person\u2026 this goes double right now.  I just spent some time putting in some job applications myself (not for HR, lol) and got about 15 interviews. And idk if it\u2019s because of COVID uncertainty or if places just don\u2019t fucking care anymore because they know people are desperate for work, but the amount of straight up illegal shit\u00a0my interviewers asked me was appalling.  (That\u2019s not even counting the questions that were technically\u00a0legal but clearly fishing for information they\u2019re not legally allowed to ask.) A tame example? Two questions into a phone interview, the guy on the other end of the line asked:\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  I said\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d - giving him a chance to rethink that.  He didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  \u201cSir, you are not allowed to ask me that question.\u201d  \u201cWell, I want to know. I\u2019m asking.\u201d  \u201cAnd you\u2019re legally not allowed to ask me that. I\u2019m not required to tell you my age.\u201d  At that point, I guess he managed to remember an old HR bulletin or something (I hope to god he wasn\u2019t actually HR himself), and he said,\u00a0\u201cWell, I need to know if you\u2019re over the age of 18.\u201d (Which is what he should have asked in the first place\u2026 or not, since that was in the application that he could have read.)  \u201cYes. I\u2019m over the age of 18.\u201d\u00a0  And we moved on. Two questions later, he tried another illegal question. I called him on it again and ended the interview, citing that a workplace with such a clear disregard for the law, especially upon first contact with a potential employee, was not going to be a good fit. (They offered me the job anyway, lol. I didn\u2019t send a thank-you or a response.) At a different interview, the majority of questions were\u00a0\u201cfishing\u201d questions - just looking for that info they\u2019re not actually allowed to ask. (This person was also either not really HR or an HR person who was exceptionally bad at their job.) I could tell they were getting frustrated when I dodged answering the personal stuff, and they actually got extremely\u00a0upset when I mentioned later in the interview (re: less relevant work experience) I had worked in HR. They were super flustered for the remainder of our time, and I watched them skip over questions on their sheet they had clearly planned on asking. They KNEW they were being sketchy and were counting on me not knowing anything about HR - or my rights - and so they got upset when I did.  These were super tame\u00a0examples. I\u2019m begging you, if you\u2019re job searching right now, PLEASE\u00a0know your rights. Please know what interviewers are allowed to ask.  Please don\u2019t volunteer information or elaborate more than you\u2019re required to about personal things. Save your words (and everyone\u2019s time) by elaborating why you\u2019re good for the position/what you can do.  I may create a resource list on this shit later but PLEASE PLEASE KNOW THIS STUFF BEFORE YOU TALK TO AN EMPLOYER. This goes for anywhere you\u2019re interviewing as well as your current employer. This also goes for HR. HR may be the person you go to when shitty stuff happens, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re your friend (or competent).  They don\u2019t need to know your age (beyond 16+, 18+, or 21+, depending on the job). They don\u2019t need to know your medical history. (For the love of god, do NOT answer the\u00a0\u201chave you been diagnosed with depression?\u201d question.) They don\u2019t need to know if you have kids or whatever. They don\u2019t need to know a LOT of those things that may appear on an application, including your veteran status, whether you\u2019re on/have been on unemployment, etc. They\u2019re not entitled to know specifics about your transportation (unless you\u2019re using that transportation for the job, like Uber/delivery drivers). Look this up for your state/the job\u2019s state.  Beware questions like\u00a0\u201cWhat year did you graduate?\u201d if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t put dates on your resume (I just put amount of time spent at employers, not dates of employment). They\u2019re fishing for your age. It\u2019s \u201cOh, you know, 100 years ago,\u201d if you feel comfortable making a joke, or\u00a0\u201cAbout [generic number, like 5 or 10] years ago\u201d if not.  Also beware things like the\u00a0\u201cWhat do you do in your free time?\u201d question, even if you already work there. This is not a friendly getting-to-know-you question. This is a basis for judgement. Not up to an invisible standard? They\u2019re going to be biased against you for pay raises, promotions, etc. Mention kids/lots of family/social engagements? That\u2019s a tick against you for not being the kind of person who lives to work (yes, it\u2019s gross and stupid). Mention lots of solitary things? Cool, that\u2019s their mental note to ask more from you because you\u2019re\u00a0\u201cnot doing anything anyway.\u201d By all means, be friendly with your coworkers/talk about shared interests if you want, but it is none\u00a0of your boss\u2019s business, and be aware what could get back to them.\u00a0  Don\u2019t. Tell. Employers. Shit.   \nWe wrote up a handy list of those illegal questions here: 10 Questions You Should Never Be Asked in a Job Interview\u00a0 \n\n\nHopefully people already know this by now, but I saw way too often back when I worked in retail.

        "url": "https://an-idiot-in-a-trenchcoat.tumblr.com/post/757042215621148672",
        "summary": "splonk-fox: Within the two episodes of The Amazing Digital Circus that have been released so far as of writing this post, there have been two characters who have been given the most attention and depth out of any of the cast (ignoring Pomni obviously), and those two characters are Ragatha and Jax. The duo consisting of the kindhearted optimist and the meanspirited pessimist have without a doubt become some of the most interesting characters to analyze within this series so far thanks to how much meaningful screentime and character depth they have been given within the the two episodes that we viewers have been fortunate enough to witness with our very eyes. But why is this? Why is it that these two have received special attention from the writers so far, and what role do they play in Pomni\u2019s character journey? Well I believe I may have found the answer, and it\u2019s unfortunately one that does not spell a good future for these characters. But to truly understand where I am coming from, we must first understand who these two characters are and how they relate to our main protagonist. To start off with the kindest of the duo, we have already learned quite a lot about Ragatha thanks to the two episodes she has been featured in so far. Her most prominent character trait is without a doubt her kindness. She is the first person to really be genuinely nice to Pomni upon her entrance to the circus and spends the rest of the episode showing her around the place and trying her best to help her get settled in. She\u2019s also someone who doesn\u2019t like to be overly blunt with her responses, such is shown when Pomni asks how they leave the circus, to which Ragatha, instead of just saying that she couldn\u2019t, phrases it in a way that makes it sound as if they simply haven\u2019t found a way to leave yet, this was obviously done in an attempt to not freak Pomni out too much, though this doesn\u2019t really go anywhere thanks to Jax. Now that\u2019s great and all, Ragatha\u2019s a nice person, you can easily observe that through casual watches of the show, looking deeper however, you can see that there is a lot more going on with Ragatha than she would like to make you believe. Insecurity is another trait that Ragatha has that, while not shown off as prominently as her optimism, is still very important to Ragatha\u2019s character. As we see in episode 2 of the series, one of Ragatha\u2019s biggest fears is not being liked. She vents to Kinger about how she feels like Pomni doesn\u2019t really like her that much, and that clearly scares her. And why wouldn\u2019t it? The end of episode 2 makes it clear that one of the most important things in this show when it comes to keeping the main cast mentally stable, is their sense of community. They\u2019re all in this together, they have each other\u2019s backs and will do their best to be there for each other when it\u2019s needed. That is what is communicated to us within the second episode through Kaufmo\u2019s funeral. This segment of the episode, while somber in its tone, is also one that instills hope within Pomni and the viewer. Because it shows that despite everything, the circus members do care about each other. That abstraction is something that affects everyone and it isn\u2019t something that is just brushed off immediately, which if you recall, was the crux of Pomni\u2019s fears as seen at the beginning of the second episode, the fear of being forgotten, the fear of no one caring. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember her name honestly\u201d - Dream Jax. So with how the importance of community has been firmly established within this show\u2019s messaging at this point, it should be no surprise that Ragatha\u2019s biggest fear is not having that community. Of people not liking you, of people hating you. So how does Ragatha solve this?  Repression, that\u2019s how. Of all of Ragatha\u2019s personality traits her tendency to not display her true feelings towards things are without a doubt the most damaging. The best example of this is how she reacts to Pomni abandoning her for the exit. The pilot would lead you to believe that she was mad at Pomni for doing this, that she didn\u2019t trust her anymore because of this selfish act. And yet, that\u2019s all brushed to the side in the following episode. Ragatha is back to her optimistic self and is saying that everything is fine! That it was completely understandable and that there was no bad blood between them. Yet you can tell that isn\u2019t the whole truth, that Ragatha really didn\u2019t get over what Pomni had done to her that easily. Now do I think Ragatha hates Pomni or secretly resents her? No, not really. I do think she\u2019s being honest when she says that she doesn\u2019t hold anything against her for doing this. But that doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t hurt by it. We can see clear as day from the pilot that this did affect her, so why does she act like she doesn\u2019t? Because, from her perspective, her feelings do not matter. The only thing that does is to make sure Pomni is able to adjust, to make sure that everyone is happy, that everyone is still somewhat sane within the circus, and so she compromises her emotions in order to do this. Gooseworx has even said it herself that Ragatha often says things she doesn\u2019t necessarily mean in order to ease tensions. She doesn\u2019t want to cause conflict, she doesn\u2019t want people to fight with each other because she understands how important community is to the members of the circus persisting. Yet in the midst of all of this, what Ragatha fails to realize is that with how she currently handles things, she is paving the way for her own mental break. Ragatha, in her attempts to be there for others, has walled herself off from others being there for her. By lying about how she really feels about things, by acting as if she is fine, she is not allowing herself the emotional vulnerability necessary for others to be there for her when she needs it. The closest thing we have had to this so far is with Kinger, and while having someone she feels comfortable enough to lament her feelings around is a good thing, this is one person, one person who is\u2026 not exactly mentally stable, to put it lightly. Is not exactly an end all be all solution to her problems. Kinger being the only person who Ragatha can rely on is only gonna work for a limited amount of time, the more she represses, the more she hides her true emotions and clear mental instability, the closer she is to meeting a cruel fate, one that no one would be able to save her from because no one even realized there was something wrong with her. For in her pursuit to make everyone else happy, she has sacrificed her own happiness, as a result. And then there\u2019s Jax. Jax, in a lot of ways, is pretty much the polar opposite of Ragatha. While her leading trait is kindness, Jax\u2019s leading trait is being a complete and utter asshole. And while Ragatha is all about answering things in a roundabout way to ease stress, Jax is all about the blunt answers. This is best shown to us in the pilot when, in the same scene where Ragatha tries to answer Pomni\u2019s question of \u201chow do I leave?\u201d in a way that wouldn\u2019t stress her out too heavily, Jax goes straight in with the \u201cyou can\u2019t\u201d. Jax is a pessimist, he has accepted that there is no way out, and is simply riding things as they go by. Jax\u2019s leading character trait is all about causing as much chaos as he can for the sake of his own satisfaction. He doesn\u2019t care about how others feel, the only thing he cares about is causing as much chaos as possible simply because he can. Yet that isn\u2019t all that\u2019s going on with Jax, there\u2019s something deeper here, something more complex. When it comes to the scenes everyone points to when saying that Jax has a lot more going on with him than meets the eye, the scene where he reacts to Kaufmo\u2019s funeral is the one everyone looks at with an analytical lens, and that\u2019s for a good reason. For I think this little scene might just tell us a lot more about Jax than we think.  One thing that I\u2019ve come to notice about Jax\u2019s brand of chaos is that it\u2019s very reliant on others\u2019 reactions. All of the chaos he causes, all of the absurd and awful things he does are for the sake of seeing how others react. From throwing Pomni over the side of a truck and attempting to use her as a human bridge, or literally everything that he does to Gangle, it\u2019s all reaction-based, and that made me realize that, despite how selfish and uncaring he acts towards everyone else, community is still the one thing that truly matters most. He needs the others so that they can react to his hijinx, as they are what give said actions meaning. If he had no crowd to watch as he acts like a shitty person, then he has no reason to do anything. But that is also where Jax\u2019s true character flaw comes in, his selfishness. With how Jax is constantly pushing others around for the sake of his own amusement, Jax is very clearly a self-centered person. He is someone who is in it for himself and no one else. Who cares if others don\u2019t like him? Who cares if others despise him? As long as he gets to see funny things happen to people, he is gonna be okay. But what happens when that method is no longer effective? What happens when the others don\u2019t give him the reaction he wants? What happens when he can no longer use chaos as a way to distract from the pointlessness of his reality? Well, as scary as this may be to think about, Jax won\u2019t really have much of anything to fall back on. His cruel actions have wrote him into a corner. No one likes him, that much is obvious. And while Jax seems content with this now? What happens when he is put in the position of needing someone else\u2019s help? Well, then he\u2019ll have no one, and it\u2019s ironically for the exact opposite reason to Ragatha. Ragatha\u2019s problem is that she is constantly repressing her emotions, despite the fact that she has people who care about her, she doesn\u2019t open up to them because in her eyes, her feelings are secondary to others\u2019. Yet Jax is the opposite, he\u2019s honest, he is self-centered, and that\u2019s also why he is one of the members who are in this most danger.  In a show that seems to be about how important community is and how important it is to stay together and be there for each other? To have a character who is the complete opposite of that. To have someone who doesn\u2019t care about others, who won\u2019t be there when someone else is hurting. To have someone who is actively making things harder for everyone\u2026 that just spells out demise. Jax\u2019s true weakness is that he does not have a community who will be there for him when he needs it, he was never there for others so why should they be there for him? Meaning that when Jax is at the end of his rope, crying out for help, no one will listen, because as cruel as it sounds, most of the members would probably be happy that he\u2019s gone. While this does admittedly rely a bit on speculation, I think what I\u2019ve stated above might be the true reason for why Jax looked sad for a moment when the other characters were talking about the funerals held for those who have abstracted. Because in that small moment, he realizes he might not get a funeral of his own when he \u201cdies\u201d, or if he did, no one would really have anything nice to say about him. And that fear, that knowing of how the way you\u2019ve built yourself up by putting others down has lead to everyone hating you, to everyone not having a single good thing to say about you\u2026 that is terrifying. And yet he hides it, he walks away, he refuses to attend the funeral because then he will have to be confronted with the uncomfortable reality of the fact that he won\u2019t die as someone who was remembered for doing good things. The only thing he\u2019ll be remembered for, is how much everyone hated him. And all of that brings us right back, to Pomni. I said at the beginning of this post, as well as with the title itself, that Ragatha and Jax matter to Pomni\u2019s character arc, but why is this? Sure they\u2019re both main characters so obviously they\u2019re going to influence her journey going forward, but how exactly does any of this matter to Pomni? It\u2019s simple really. Ragatha and Jax represent two extremes, they represent what happens when you lean too far in one direction. In one case, it is caring too much about others and not caring about yourself, and in the other, it\u2019s caring too much about yoursef and not caring about others. Pomni has already shown traits of both Jax and Ragatha. She has shown an empathetic, kindhearted side as seen in her interactions with Gummigoo, and she has shown a selfish side, as seen when she abandoned Ragatha for the \u201cexit\u201d in the pilot. Pomni has shown herself to be both selfish and selfless. But what part of her matters more? Simple answer, both. It is important to care about others while also taking time to take care of yourself. Ragatha and Jax show what happens when you forget to do one of these things. By always taking care of others, you\u2019re forgetting to take care of yourself, and by always taking care of yourself, you fail to take care of others. To find a healthy balance is to do both. To be aware of your own mental health while also making sure that others are doing okay too. And this is something that Pomni will need to realize if she is going to make it in the circus. And this is where Jax and Ragatha become important. I believe these two will show Pomni how important it is to keep a balance of things. To not lean too far in one direction, as if you do, it spells bad news for you either way. And how will this be communicated to her and the audience? Abstraction. Think about it. If Ragatha and Jax\u2019s harmful practices continue without change and they end up abstracing because of it, that will be a wakeup call to Pomni, it will show her the flaws of being too selfless, and too selfish. Is it an extreme way to communicate such message? Sure, but it\u2019s also one that can\u2019t be ignored. We, the audience, and Pomni, would see first hand the consequences of leaning too far in either direction, that if you don\u2019t find a balance, you will end up like Jax and Ragatha did. And that\u2019s why I think these two in particular have been given so much screentime and attention these past two episodes. Because they are meant to show us the most extreme versions of Pomni\u2019s most prominent character traits. The ability to care about yourself, and the ability to care about others. Of course, I might be wrong in this assessment. We are far too early in the show\u2019s runtime to truly predict any big events like this. But from a narrative standpoint, I believe this interpretation makes the most sense in the way of showing us the audience, and Pomni, what truly matters. It\u2019s not just about you, it\u2019s not just about others, it\u2019s about both. Thank you for reading.",

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

        "summary": "Can Poor Sleep Contribute to the Development of Psychiatric Disorders? \nThe Hidden Link Between Sleep and Mental Health \nIn our fast-paced world, sleep often takes a backseat to work, social obligations, and entertainment. However, the importance of sleep cannot be overstated, especially when it comes to our mental health. Research has increasingly shown that poor sleep can significantly contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders. Let\u2019s delve deeper into this crucial issue to understand how lack of quality sleep can impact mental well-being. \nThe Science Behind Sleep and Brain Function \nSleep is a complex biological process that plays a pivotal role in maintaining cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and emotional regulation. During sleep, the brain undergoes various restorative processes, including the clearance of toxic waste products that accumulate during waking hours. Disruptions in sleep can interfere with these processes, leading to cognitive impairments and emotional instability. \nHow Poor Sleep Affects Mental Health \n1. Mood Disorders \nPoor sleep is closely linked to mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Chronic sleep deprivation can alter brain function and neurochemical balances, exacerbating symptoms of these disorders. For instance, a lack of sleep can reduce the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, leading to increased feelings of sadness and irritability. \n2. Anxiety Disorders \nPeople who experience poor sleep are more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders. Sleep deprivation heightens the activity of the amygdala, the part of the brain responsible for fear and anxiety responses. This can make individuals more prone to anxiety attacks and general feelings of unease.",

In response, government authorities, IBM Consulting, and Microsoft are working together to create a platform that will improve the provision of social services to underserved communities and bridge the\u00a0gap. Their common\u00a0goalCommunity challenges including violence, mental health, food insecurity, homelessness, and juvenile justice arise daily. Many government agencies are using transformative approaches to create a society where everyone gets the resources and support they need. Consider the government officials who are implementing the \u201cCare First\u201d approach. The goal of this strategy is to divert thousands of people from the criminal justice system and place them in helpful programs designed to meet their requirements for \u201cre-entry into society.\u201d These initiatives support local communities by providing housing, transportation, access to drug rehab centres, and other necessary services. Some creative leaders are committed to improving maternal health, reducing violence, and preparing young people in transition for success. In order to integrate social services across health, education, and other crucial sectors, a larger percentage of leaders are adopting a whole-person care strategy and concentrating on the community as a whole rather than on particular groups. Announcing Connect360 IBMWhile a plethora of diverse services and initiatives are accessible to several government organisations worldwide. They are unable to provide these systems\u2019 power to the communities and individuals who actually need it, though. Users frequently have to work with individual systems and services since the underlying data, technology, and delivery models were designed in\u00a0silos. Connect360 IBM enables the delivery of integrated social services, converts data into useful information, and encourages cooperation across agencies. The five main objectives of this solution are as\u00a0follows: Establish an electronic information exchange system to facilitate cooperation.Increased public access to resources and services through information sharingEnable the public to actively participate in the selection and provision of services.Boost your ability to make decisions by integrating data and using business analytics.Improve the area\u2019s interoperability to access community data.A software called Connect360 IBM allows data from different systems inside social services agencies to be effortlessly integrated. The purpose of this capability is to conform various data sources to the HSDS (Human Services Data Specification) and HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards. This is to ensure that data is easily accessible, standardised, and protected. In order to provide continuity and coordination of treatment for those in need, Connect360 IBM also enables interoperability of health-related data with a variety of healthcare systems by complying to the HL7 FHIR standard. This transformation allows for easy connectivity with other apps in addition to making the data easily accessible within Connect360 IBM\u00a0. Service providers can then share and update information to help those who depend on these essential services in a coordinated and efficient manner. The amount of isolation, security, performance, scale, and dependability needed to manage sensitive workloads across a wide range of particular requirements is provided by Connect360 IBM\u00a0, which is hosted on Microsoft Azure. Future improvements to Connect360 IBM will be built upon the foundation laid by IBM and Microsoft\u2019s commitment to advancing responsible, secure, and trustworthy AI. Changing lives using Microsoft Azure and IBM Connect360A wide range of initiatives from several ministries, including housing, justice, mental health, social services, and health, are included in the category of social services. Their common goal is to assist people with complicated needs. Interdepartmental cooperation is necessary to meet these objectives and improve client results. The involvement of Community-Based Organisations (CBOs) and Communication Service Providers (CSPs) via the departments\u2019 network is another important element in attaining improved results. Departments are accountable for providing a common resource repository that their partners can use to deliver services, in addition to directly providing services. Support for the operational model in use is provided by Connect360 IBM\u00a0. The basic systems and APIs in this paradigm are provided by the government agency, and they allow access to the core systems almost instantly. Through the use of these APIs, different business applications from different departments can communicate with one\u00a0another. Every participant in this model concentrates on their primary competencies: While CSPs and CBOs can develop client-facing, service-oriented apps, the agency handles data management, sets business rules, assures compliance, and assesses performance. This strategy makes effective use of the agency\u2019s current resources to enable the quick implementation of new healthcare and public assistance initiatives. Throughout the launch phase, the ecosystem cooperates to guarantee that clients receive services on time and without any interruptions. \u201cThey at IBM recognise the value of efficient coordination and communication amongst government agencies,\u201d stated Cristina Caballe Fuguet, Vice President of IBM Consulting\u2019s Global Public Sector. Government organisations may communicate with the public, exchange information, and get input in a safe and expandable setting with Connect360 IBM. They take great pride in the way Connect360 IBM and Microsoft Azure are assisting governments everywhere in providing better services to their inhabitants and constructing more robust and resilient communities. Case Study: How is the life of a single citizen being changed by IBM Connect\u00a0360?Let\u2019s look at the made-up tale of Michael, a soldier who was having difficulty adjusting to civilian life. He struggled with PTSD, mental health problems, and substance misuse before becoming imprisoned in a cycle of homelessness. How did he benefit from IBM Connect\u00a0360? Michael created his Connect360 IBM account with the assistance of a care coordinator. After he gave details about his situation, Connect360 IBM evaluated his requirements and made recommendations that were specifically suited for him. These suggestions included services like short-term housing, drug rehab, mental health assistance, transportation, skill development, and eventually assisted him in locating employment. Michael became more self-assured and self-sufficient with every step. He made good use of the suggested resources, took comfort in his caring network of carers, and piece by piece, he rebuilt his life. In his quest for stability, the technological answer served as more than simply a roadmap it was a continuous companion. This story goes beyond simply one man\u2019s journey to stability; it demonstrates how effective tools and a caring support system can actually improve a person\u2019s life. Michael\u2019s case serves as evidence of both the effectiveness of empathetic intervention and the prospective uses of technology in social support networks. A brighter future is not just a fantasy but a probable reality with the correct resources and assistance. Change is always possible. These results may be achieved at scale when governments, communities, Microsoft, IBM Consulting, and others work together. Firsthand experience the transforming powerWith the help of Microsoft Azure, Connect360 IBM, and the IBM Community Health user interface, this formidable solution has the ability to significantly improve people\u2019s lives.

From identifying and coordinating with the service providers that can best meet an individual\u2019s needs to accurately measuring the treatment and results received. Angela Heise, Corporate Vice President, Worldwide Public Sector at Microsoft, stated, \u201cIBM Connect360 ensures that every aspect of community service delivery is enhanced, fostering a more connected, efficient, and impactful system.\u201d \u201cThey are eager to advance the solution and maintain their strategic partnership with IBM Consulting.\u201d This platform stands out for its ability to serve a broad spectrum of stakeholders.

This is especially important to people in states like mine where abortion is entirely inaccessible.  Opill can be ordered online with no doctor visit and is currently available at $50 for 3 months worth, which is not bad.  Could help a lot of people!

Also awarded one billion dollars to support student wellness and school mental health professionals (which is the field I work in)Helped broker a deal to save the Colorado river.  There\u2019s something simply existential about a water crisis, and I have a lot of family living in the affected area, so it\u2019s nice to get some progress on this.Invested millions of federal funds into cancer research, with the goal to halve death rates over the next 25 years.  I unfortunately know several people who have/have had cancer, and it could happen to anyone, so it\u2019s always nice to see progress made in this area.Made it harder for companies to engage in union busting.  This doesn\u2019t directly affect me yet as I\u2019m not currently in a union, but I sure hope to be someday!The infrastructure deal is pouring 1.2 trillion dollars of investment into roads, bridges, airports, waterlines and broadband networks.

HOWEVER. i would throw her with akane if there weren\u2019t already four people in that house lmao.  - gonta either goes with tenko here or gundham i think!!! if he went with tenko he would provide a bit of levity there and actually talk to mondo, really trying to make a good impression and SERIOUSLY pushing to be a gentleman because he is now compensating for both him AND tenko and he doesn\u2019t want them getting kicked out. makes friends with chihiro whenever she comes over but gets unusually uncomfortable when the \u201cmondo killed chihiro\u201d conversation happens because he has been grappling with the guilt of killing miu this entire time and is truly horrified he was ever capable of doing something like that. chihiro\u2019s programming prowess definitely reminds him of miu and he just starts getting really fidgety around her all of the sudden lmao. if i were to throw him with gundham id have them draw parallels between gundham sacrificing himself for his class versus gonta nearly sacrificing his class, and that skewed idea of \u201cthe greater good\u201d!!!! gonta isn\u2019t scared of all of the animals that gundham has in his house either LMAO - i think i\u2019d have kaede and himiko together and i\u2019d put them with SAYAKA AND AOI? the two of them were on a tense girls trip when all of the sudden BAM TWO VERY IMPORTANT SEASON 53 ESCAPEES. kaede works herself to the bone with guilt and helps sayaka with all of the work she has to take on as somebody who is very good at being a danganronpa saleswoman. himiko, who is severely depressed and chronically fatigued, is pushed into a room with a bunch of overachievers. she WANTS to help but she truly can\u2019t muster the energy, and because she didn\u2019t die in the simulator she thinks she can\u2019t make excuses and just has a \u201clazy personality\u201d. sayaka gets to deal with a musician that mirrors her ruthless dedication that is very slowly killing her. aoi has to confront her own survivors guilt (id probably be drawing tenko/sakura comparisons here) and finally admit that Wowwww the way she has had to drop everything for danganronpa and never blame them for anything sucks really bad even if i\u2019m not one of the \u201cimportant survivors\u201d. kaede and himiko both keep influencing the other to work harder (kaede to make up for himiko, himiko because she feels pressured to keep up) and it\u2019s DIRE!!!! - i think id put kaito with nekomaru ??? i\u2019ve got a story i think. kaito is really good at matching nekomarus energy and seems like he\u2019s genuinely doing pretty alright for a kid that just DIED. he follows all of nekomarus training and does wayyy more than is necessary, and is super keen on finding the rest of his class. while all of this is happening i reckon nekomaru is both a) dealing with akane and his own feelings of failure and b) still got health stuff going on (OR. he THINKS he does and danganronpa is handing him placebos or smth) and NEEDS to keep danganronpa happy because they are literally providing him medication. nekomaru starts deteriorating with stress but kaito just seems to be taking on a lot of that work for him, which gives nekomaru a good mirror of what he does for others and allows him to finally go up to kaito and be like \u201chey man. this isn\u2019t healthy actually\u201d to which kaito goes \u201cFUCK\ud83d\ude0d\u201d and starts crying - shuichiiiiiii shuichi i just don\u2019t know bro\u2026\u2026 i really can\u2019t think of a storyline with him that doesn\u2019t mirror what he already went through in game, especially regarding self esteem!!! yknow what maybe i just say fuck it and make up a whole new scenario for this guy. kyoko pov, shuichi DIDNT escape but is being tasked with helping kyoko find where the missing participants are. it\u2019s a byakuya pov situation where kyoko gets a chapter for every new cycle. it becomes a game of her attempting to outsmart another detective, revealing enough information that it isn\u2019t sketchy to danganronpa but not too much that shuichi figures it out. shuichi gets to talk about his classmates and his relationships with them, and slowly throughout the pov he is getting really distressed by how rapidly season 54 is approaching without having found anybody. this will also provide some context as to how the kids still in the hospital are doing!! at the end of it all it gets revealed shuichi knew what was up WAY long ago but just hadn\u2019t been telling, and there\u2019s a big moment where he COULD reveal and save his own ass but he chooses not to so that his classmates could go free or smth. huge moment to see this because kyoko and a lot of the earlier seasons have been beaten into submission so badly that most of them would have taken that deal and ratted the others out  - unsure about maki tbh\u2026\u2026 she would be introduced super late into the story i think. i\u2019ll be real with you i think she breaks into somebody\u2019s home repeatedly and keeps stealing things LMAO, eventually gets caught only for the person to go No no it\u2019s fine!!! Take my food and also this coat because god it is cold out there and you must be freezing. honestly i can see sonia taking her in. a lotttt of parallels to be drawn there regarding their love interests being written for them and how they\u2019ve both been sensationalized as \u201cfemale love interests who lost their loves in a sacrificial manner\u201d. maki disappears into sonia\u2019s house most days but occasionally she reappears to ask her questions (about danganronpa mainly) and they get to talking that way. i\u2019d write it so that maki would hide in rooms that eventually get closer and closer to sonia\u2019s room until eventually she\u2019s sleeping against sonias door because she\u2019s paranoid for both of them and thinks it would be safer if she was there - tsumugi is a danganronpa employee so she\u2019s allowed to walk around whenever \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14 lmao",

        "summary": "Life is a series of constant transitions, each one shifting the landscape of our existence in subtle yet profound ways. One powerful concept to grasp in the realm of personal growth and healing is the idea that \u201cnothing is displaced unless replaced.\u201d This notion not only resonates with the psychology of healing but also offers a profound understanding of how time and timing play critical roles in our journey forward. \n\n\n\nWhen we experience loss\u2014whether it\u2019s a relationship, a job, or a cherished dream\u2014the initial feeling is often one of emptiness or displacement. We might feel as if a part of ourselves has been lost or removed, leaving a void that seems insurmountable. However, the truth is that nothing is truly displaced without the possibility of replacement. \n\n\n\nIn psychological terms, healing involves processing these losses and finding new forms of meaning or fulfillment. This process can be likened to a cycle of displacement and replacement. Just as an old habit or thought pattern makes way for a new one, personal growth requires that we let go of what no longer serves us to make space for new experiences, relationships, or insights. The idea is that we must replace what was lost with something that nurtures or enriches us.",

        "summary": "RESUMO DA MAT\u00c9RIA Usar um colete com peso ao caminhar pode levar a ganhos significativos no desempenho f\u00edsico e na sa\u00fade.Isso ativa mais m\u00fasculos, ajudando a desenvolver for\u00e7a e resist\u00eancia, e pode contribuir para o aumento do metabolismo, manter ossos fortes e facilitar as tarefas di\u00e1rias.Em um estudo com mulheres entre 65 e 74 anos que participaram de um programa de exerc\u00edcios usando um colete de peso, a for\u00e7a muscular dos membros inferiores melhorou de 10% a 11%.Usar um colete de peso pode representar risco de les\u00f5es, sobretudo se o peso for muito pesado, n\u00e3o estiver equilibrado de forma adequada ou se voc\u00ea tiver uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9-existente, como artrite.Para minimizar os riscos, comece com um peso leve e fa\u00e7a um aumento gradual da carga conforme seu corpo se adapta; certifique-se tamb\u00e9m de que o colete se ajusta de forma correta e que o peso est\u00e1 distribu\u00eddo de maneira mais uniforme.Por Dr. Mercola Caminhar \u00e9 uma excelente forma de exerc\u00edcio que n\u00e3o pode ser exagerada, ao contr\u00e1rio de formas mais intensas de atividade f\u00edsica, como treinamento intervalado de alta intensidade e treinamento de for\u00e7a. Al\u00e9m de ter baixo impacto, pode ser feito em quase qualquer lugar e n\u00e3o requer equipamento especial. Al\u00e9m disso, caminhar \u00e9 uma atividade humana natural, como respirar, dormir e comer, o que indica sua utilidade para o condicionamento f\u00edsico. A caminhada \u00e9 apropriada para atletas iniciantes e experientes, e sua versatilidade permite ajustar a intensidade e a dura\u00e7\u00e3o para corresponder aos seus n\u00edveis de condicionamento f\u00edsico e atingir seus objetivos de exerc\u00edcio. Embora aumentar a velocidade, caminhar em inclina\u00e7\u00f5es ou percorrer dist\u00e2ncias mais longas sejam m\u00e9todos \u00fateis para variar o treino de caminhada, outra forma de aumentar a intensidade da atividade \u00e9 usar um colete de peso, que oferece benef\u00edcios e alguns riscos a serem observados. Benef\u00edcios de usar um colete de peso na sua pr\u00f3xima caminhadaO esfor\u00e7o extra necess\u00e1rio para carregar um colete com pesos far\u00e1 seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o bater muito mais r\u00e1pido do que uma caminhada normal, podendo levar a ganhos significativos no desempenho f\u00edsico e na sa\u00fade. Adicionar peso extra requer mais gasto de energia, levando a uma maior queima de calorias e \u00e0 melhoria da sa\u00fade cardiovascular em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com caminhar sem peso adicional. Isso tamb\u00e9m ativa mais m\u00fasculos, ajudando a aumentar a for\u00e7a e a resist\u00eancia. Em um estudo com 11 mulheres com idades entre 65 e 74 anos que participaram de um programa de exerc\u00edcios usando um colete de peso, a for\u00e7a muscular dos membros inferiores melhorou de 10% a 11%, enquanto o tempo para subir escadas melhorou em 9%. A pot\u00eancia para subir escadas tamb\u00e9m melhorou cerca de 10%. \u201cAs magnitude das melhorias observadas sugerem que o treino com passos usando pesos tem o potencial de prolongar a independ\u00eancia e prevenir problemas de sa\u00fade relacionados \u00e0 idade, como a sarcopenia,\u201d explicou a equipe no Journal of Clinical Medicine. Al\u00e9m disso, usar um colete de peso pode ajudar a aumentar o metabolismo, manter ossos fortes e facilitar as tarefas di\u00e1rias. A carga extra de um colete de peso pode ajudar a estimular o crescimento \u00f3sseo e manter a densidade \u00f3ssea, reduzindo o risco de osteoporose. Outro estudo examinou como o uso de um colete com peso afeta o uso de oxig\u00eanio, a intensidade do exerc\u00edcio, as for\u00e7as verticais de rea\u00e7\u00e3o do solo e a taxa de carga do corpo ao caminhar em uma esteira. Dez jovens caminharam na esteira em velocidades diferentes, usando coletes com pesos de 0%, 10%, 15% ou 20% do \u00edndice de massa corporal. Os pesquisadores mediram a quantidade de oxig\u00eanio que usavam, o quanto trabalhavam e as for\u00e7as exercidas sobre os p\u00e9s e as pernas. Descobriu-se que o uso de colete com peso aumentou o consumo de oxig\u00eanio e a intensidade do exerc\u00edcio, em especial em velocidades mais altas. A for\u00e7a nas pernas dos participantes e a taxa de impacto tamb\u00e9m foram maiores quando usaram coletes mais pesados. Os pesquisadores conclu\u00edram que usar um colete com pesos durante a caminhada aumenta a energia necess\u00e1ria, torna o exerc\u00edcio mais intenso e coloca mais carga nos ossos e m\u00fasculos. Outro estudo com 20 indiv\u00edduos revelou que usar um colete de peso \u2013 com peso de 9 kg para homens e 6 kg para mulheres \u2013 aumentou o esfor\u00e7o f\u00edsico ao caminhar em uma esteira com inclina\u00e7\u00e3o de 10%. No entanto, isso n\u00e3o alterou a forma como os sujeitos andavam ou corriam e n\u00e3o aumentou o risco de les\u00f5es nos membros inferiores. Os seres humanos foram feitos para carregar peso?Embora muitas pessoas optem por correr para se exercitar, Michael Easter, professor da Universidade de Nevada, em Las Vegas, argumenta que n\u00e3o nascemos para correr, e sim para carregar peso. \u201c\u00c0 medida que fomos evoluindo, a pr\u00e1tica de corrida era rara. Era realizada sobretudo para ca\u00e7adas. Tribos modernas como os Tarahumara, por exemplo, nunca correm apenas por divers\u00e3o. Correr \u00e9 para ca\u00e7a e cerim\u00f4nias religiosas\u2026 Carregar pesos, por outro lado, \u00e9 algo que n\u00f3s, humanos, sempre fizemos enquanto evolu\u00edmos. Portanto, as evid\u00eancias sugerem que n\u00f3s nascemos para carregar pesos\u201d, escreve ele. Os humanos carregavam cargas de 4 a 9 kg como ca\u00e7adores-coletores. Ap\u00f3s a ca\u00e7a, os humanos tamb\u00e9m carregavam cargas maiores, de 36 kg ou mais. A revolu\u00e7\u00e3o agr\u00edcola mudou a necessidade de transporte dos seres humanos, e a nossa aptid\u00e3o f\u00edsica ainda pode estar a sofrer devido \u00e0 essa mudan\u00e7a. Segundo Easter: \u201cA nova tecnologia acabou com a nossa necessidade de correr ou carregar pesos. Evolu\u00edmos de mulas e bois carregando nossas coisas para carrinhos de compras, malas com rodas e Amazon Prime deixando qualquer coisa na porta da nossa casa. Mas, ao contr\u00e1rio da corrida, a maioria de n\u00f3s nunca fez uma reengenharia do transporte em nossos dias - exceto os ruckers\".O termo rucking vem de caminhar com mochila, ou rucks, que s\u00e3o exerc\u00edcios usados \u200b\u200bdurante o treinamento militar. No entanto, o rucking, que envolve caminhar ou fazer trilhas com uma mochila pesada, tamb\u00e9m ganhou for\u00e7a como atividade f\u00edsica para civis que buscam melhorar sua resist\u00eancia e fortalecer m\u00fasculos. Semelhante ao uso de um colete com pesos, o rucking combina os benef\u00edcios do exerc\u00edcio cardiovascular com o treino de for\u00e7a, pois o peso adicional aumenta as demandas f\u00edsicas do corpo. Voc\u00ea queima mais calorias \u2014 cerca de 30% a 45% mais \u2014 caminhando com uma mochila pesada do que sem. Al\u00e9m de trabalhar todos os m\u00fasculos t\u00edpicos que voc\u00ea usa ao caminhar, o rucking envolve as pernas, costas, ombros e m\u00fasculos centrais durante a atividade. Em um estudo sobre caminhada com carga, a caminhada com pesos levou a melhorias significativas nas respostas psicof\u00edsicas, incluindo aumentos na for\u00e7a m\u00e1xima do agachamento e salto, flex\u00f5es, abdominais e consumo m\u00e1ximo estimado de oxig\u00eanio, ap\u00f3s 10 semanas. Quais s\u00e3o os riscos de caminhar com colete de peso?Usar um colete de peso pode representar risco de les\u00f5es, sobretudo se o peso for muito pesado ou se voc\u00ea tiver uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9-existente, como artrite. O peso adicional pode aumentar a carga nas articula\u00e7\u00f5es, em especial nos joelhos, quadris e tornozelos, o que pode causar dores nas articula\u00e7\u00f5es ou agravar os problemas articulares existentes. O uso inadequado de um colete de peso tamb\u00e9m pode afetar sua postura. Se o peso n\u00e3o estiver distribu\u00eddo de maneira uniforme ou se voc\u00ea compensar alterando a marcha, isso pode causar desequil\u00edbrios e problemas musculoesquel\u00e9ticos, como dores nas costas ou tens\u00e3o nos ombros. Se voc\u00ea estiver caminhando em temperaturas altas, lembre-se tamb\u00e9m de que o colete pode cans\u00e1-lo mais r\u00e1pido e dificultar o resfriamento. Para minimizar esses riscos, \u00e9 importante come\u00e7ar com um peso leve e aumentar a carga de forma gradual \u00e0 medida que o seu corpo se adapta. Al\u00e9m disso, garantir o ajuste e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o adequados do peso, manter uma boa postura e permitir um tempo de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o adequado pode ajudar a evitar poss\u00edveis problemas. O colete deve ser confort\u00e1vel, ter o peso distribu\u00eddo de maneira uniforme e n\u00e3o deve restringir seus movimentos ou respira\u00e7\u00e3o. Um colete mal ajustado pode causar desconforto e aumentar o risco de les\u00f5es. \u00c0 medida que sua for\u00e7a e resist\u00eancia melhoram, voc\u00ea pode comprar uma mochila projetada com al\u00e7as largas e acolchoadas e uma al\u00e7a na cintura para ajudar a manter a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o uniforme do peso. Adicione apenas dois ou quatro quilos de peso por vez, at\u00e9 chegar a carregar um ter\u00e7o do seu peso corporal. Por que caminhar faz bem para voc\u00eaSe voc\u00ea \u00e9 novo nos exerc\u00edcios ou n\u00e3o pratica atividade f\u00edsica h\u00e1 algum tempo, pode ser melhor come\u00e7ar a caminhar sem um colete de peso at\u00e9 construir uma base s\u00f3lida de condicionamento f\u00edsico. Mesmo uma simples caminhada pode levar a ganhos impressionantes de condicionamento f\u00edsico, sem o risco de exagerar. \u00c9 importante entender que exerc\u00edcio intenso em excesso pode ser prejudicial. Um estudo pioneiro que mudou de forma radical minha vis\u00e3o sobre exerc\u00edcios foi publicado pelo Dr. James OKeefe, cardiologista do Mid-America Heart Institute do St. Louis Hospital em Kansas City, e tr\u00eas co-autores. Se voc\u00ea for sedent\u00e1rio e come\u00e7ar a se exercitar, ter\u00e1 uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o dependente da dose na mortalidade, diabetes, depress\u00e3o, press\u00e3o alta, doen\u00e7a coronariana, osteoporose, sarcopenia, quedas e outros. Mas as pessoas que praticam o maior volume de exerc\u00edcios intensos come\u00e7am a perder os benef\u00edcios da longevidade. Se voc\u00ea pratica triatlos de longa dist\u00e2ncia aos 40 e 50 anos, o risco de fibrila\u00e7\u00e3o atrial aumenta de 500% a 800%. No entanto, no caso de exerc\u00edcios moderados \u2013 definidos no geral como exerc\u00edcios at\u00e9 o ponto em que voc\u00ea fica um pouco sem f\u00f4lego, mas ainda consegue conversar \u2013 h\u00e1 evid\u00eancias claras de que mais \u00c9 melhor e n\u00e3o pode ser exagerado. Nesse sentido, caminhar \u00e9 uma poderosa interven\u00e7\u00e3o antienvelhecimento que pode reduzir o risco de doen\u00e7as cr\u00f4nicas\u00a0 relacionadas com a idade, como doen\u00e7as card\u00edacas, hipertens\u00e3o, diabetes tipo 2 e c\u00e2ncer, ao mesmo tempo que alivia a dor e melhora a fun\u00e7\u00e3o em dist\u00farbios m\u00fasculo-esquel\u00e9ticos. Outros benef\u00edcios da caminhada incluem melhor sono e maior resili\u00eancia. Caminhar pode at\u00e9 ajudar a reverter os mecanismos celulares e moleculares subjacentes ao envelhecimento, rejuvenescendo suas mitoc\u00f4ndrias. O exerc\u00edcio estimula a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de novas mitoc\u00f4ndrias e ajuda as existentes a funcionar melhor, produzindo mais energia com mais efici\u00eancia. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tomar medidas para proteger sua sa\u00fade mitocondrial, suas mitoc\u00f4ndrias poder\u00e3o se deteriorar com a idade e produzir menos energia. Um estudo descobriu, por exemplo, que caminhadas regulares de baixa intensidade podem melhorar de forma significativa a sa\u00fade das mitoc\u00f4ndrias em pessoas com toler\u00e2ncia \u00e0 glicose comprometida. Depois que os participantes participaram de um programa de caminhada de quatro meses, os pesquisadores observaram um aumento na express\u00e3o de genes relacionados \u00e0s mitoc\u00f4ndrias no m\u00fasculo esquel\u00e9tico. Esses genes est\u00e3o envolvidos na cria\u00e7\u00e3o de novas mitoc\u00f4ndrias e no aumento de sua fun\u00e7\u00e3o. Resumindo, caminhar incentivou o corpo a produzir mais mitoc\u00f4ndrias e com melhor desempenho nos m\u00fasculos. Caminhar oferece benef\u00edcios para a mente e o corpoCaminhar tamb\u00e9m traz benef\u00edcios psicol\u00f3gicos e para a mente e o corpo, quer voc\u00ea caminhe sozinho ou em grupo - em especial quando voc\u00ea caminha em um ambiente natural. A pesquisadora Marta Anna Zurawik explica na revista Human Movement: \u201cPara muitas pessoas, um passeio solit\u00e1rio em um ambiente natural \u00e9 prefer\u00edvel, pois permite uma comunh\u00e3o mais pr\u00f3xima com a natureza. Na solid\u00e3o, os indiv\u00edduos procuram afastar-se de ambientes sociais complexos, sobre os quais t\u00eam pouco controle.Assim, caminhar sozinho proporciona um ant\u00eddoto agrad\u00e1vel para o estresse e a fadiga mental atrav\u00e9s do contato com o ambiente f\u00edsico \u2013 consci\u00eancia est\u00e9tica, fasc\u00ednio pela paisagem, a experi\u00eancia de estar longe das rotinas di\u00e1rias e distanciar-se das tens\u00f5es e problemas di\u00e1rios\".Dito isso, caminhar com outras pessoas proporciona benef\u00edcios sociais que podem aliviar a solid\u00e3o e o isolamento: \u201cA caminhada em grupo \u00e9 uma forma de conviv\u00eancia, mesmo quando se est\u00e1 sozinho entre estranhos, porque permite aos caminhantes estabelecer e manter uma intimidade e familiaridade com a comunidade e criar um sentimento de pertencimento a um grupo especial, que com o tempo pode tornar-se o centro da vida social de algu\u00e9m.As caminhadas em grupo em ambientes naturais podem ter um efeito no bem-estar maior do que as caminhadas solit\u00e1rias, pois proporcionam ambientes sociais para intera\u00e7\u00f5es, desenvolvimento e fortalecimento de amizades, express\u00e3o e partilha de interesses. Essa forma de socializa\u00e7\u00e3o e proximidade emocional de apoio combate sentimentos de solid\u00e3o e isolamento, o que pode trazer benef\u00edcios significativos para o bem-estar social\u201d.Qual \u00e9 a quantidade ideal de caminhada?Quanto \u00e0 caminhada ideal, isso depende da sua idade, objetivos de sa\u00fade e n\u00edvel de condicionamento f\u00edsico. Se voc\u00ea est\u00e1 ou n\u00e3o usando um colete de peso tamb\u00e9m deve ser considerado. O americano em m\u00e9dia caminha cerca de 3.800 passos por dia, o que equivale a pouco menos de 3 km. S\u00e3o cerca de 1.240 passos por quil\u00f4metro, e cada 1.000 passos que voc\u00ea d\u00e1 em m\u00e9dia por dia reduz sua mortalidade em 10% a 15%, observa OKeefe.

        "summary": "valentineish: psychoticallytrans: : You might not want to hear this but people with anger issues and/or violent impulses need social accommodations. And no by accommodation I don\u2019t mean walking on eggshells around them, actual accommodations for people with these issues comes down to giving them a space away from what\u2019s triggering them to process their emotions and calm themselves down same as what kind of accommodations people who get sensory overload or just any kind of overwhelmed. There is no moral value to having anger issues or violent impulses, people with them are deserving of accommodation the same as everyone else. I had severe anger issues growing up, and the only way I was ever taught to deal with them was deep breathing. For some reason, deep breathing just triggers me to get angrier. But it\u2019s the only coping skill I ever got taught for it. Here\u2019s a few better ones. Go and exercise. Get all of that energy out and away from the people you love.Get a hang of when you\u2019re winding up to a rage and learn to tell people that you need to step away. I will warn you that the first time that someone refuses to let you go once you learn this skill will spook the hell out of you if you don\u2019t have a backup skill, so figure out ahead of time what you\u2019re gonna do if they won\u2019t let you leave.Learn to set boundaries. One of the best things I ever did for my anger issues was tell people that I can\u2019t deal with people stealing food off my plate. Second best was when I\u2019m mad, telling people not to touch me. I spook easily when I\u2019m already angry.Get a pack of pencils and if nothing is working, break one. Sometimes you really do need to break something in order to feel better, and pencils are cheap. Don\u2019t cook with a knife when you\u2019re mad. If you get too much adrenaline, the knife can slip and hurt you.If you have anger issues that pop up without any seeming reason and frighten you, I would strongly recommend going over the situation and over your mental health. If there\u2019s anything consistent with a mental health condition or with something particular happening to trigger it, seek to eliminate the trigger or treat the issue. Depression, anxiety, trauma, you name it, it can probably present as anger issues under the right circumstances.Some quick notes for people without anger issues that want to help someone who has anger issues: Fear transmutes into anger really, really well if someone\u2019s fear response is \u201cfight\u201d. One of my guesses for why so many men have anger issues is that we\u2019re told we\u2019re not men if we have any other response to fear. However, this issue is far from exclusive to men.Don\u2019t box people in when you\u2019re arguing with them or soothing them. If someone is backed up against a wall and upset, then getting closer to them without permission is a bad call for your safety and for their soothing, because that removes the ability to get away from you. Ask before getting close. This goes double if someone is injured or otherwise vulnerable.Teaching angry people that are distressed about being angry the pencil trick on the spot is really easy and works more often than you can think. Respect people\u2019s requests and boundaries. A lot of people think that some of the boundaries I set up are silly or that once we\u2019re pals, they can ignore them. No, because a lot of my boundaries are related to trauma, and crossing them will trigger me and bring up my anger. All of this goes for children with anger issues as well. I was a child with anger issues, and a lot of disrespect for my boundaries and needs was because my anger was dismissed because I was a child. Respect children\u2019s anger.Walking on eggshells is not and will never be a good way to treat anger issues. Recognizing that people with anger issues deserve to have their boundaries respected and to be treated like human beings is.  An end note: Anger issues are not the same thing as being abusive, because emotions are not abusive. Someone with anger issues can become abusive if they take them out on people, but so can someone with suicidal thoughts who takes them out on people. The issue is targeting another person in order to feel better, not having a mental health issue.  An end note for people with anger issues: It really can get better. You can find coping skills and perhaps meds that help cool you down and settle you. You can find people that will accept that doing that one weird thing spooks the fuck out of you, and will let you leave if you\u2019re scaring yourself. You can gain control of yourself without shutting down emotionally. It\u2019s achievable.  Additionally, anger is neither exempt from nor the sole experience of emotional dysregulation. And a lot of conditions can cause that dysregulation \u2013 PTSD (/ongoing trauma and stress, like mentioned above), dementia, ADHD, even boring old sleep deprivation are just a few examples. The list goes on, because this is an extremely common feature to many neurodivergent experiences. Emotions do not have intrinsic morality, and they are not frivolous set-dressing. Anger is no more inherently toxic than guilt is fundamentally manipulative. These are not behaviors. They are part of your internal experience, and serve as barometers for your mental well-being.  Some people will feel things more intensely or frequently. Punishing them (or yourself) for that is cruel and counterproductive. Have patience, and make the space that\u2019s needed. The world is certainly big enough for accomodations and self-growth.",

This process is known as \u201ccrop rotation.\u201d  \nSo the next time you find that you need to step away from a project to work on something else for a while, don\u2019t beat yourself up for \u201cquitting\u201d that project. Give yourself permission to practice \u201cmental crop rotation\u201d to maintain a healthy brain field.  \nBecause I\u2019ve found that when that unnecessary guilt and pressure are removed from the process, a good mental crop rotation can help you feel more energized and invigorated than ever once you\u2019re ready to rotate back to that project.",

Yeah, the CEO hasnt said they love Israel or anything, but I\u2019ve gotten sick of them announcing collaborations with Zionists despite making billions of dollars that could save billions of people. And then twitter activists cheering them on. Never mind their pro colonization rhetoric found in two of their games.

I\u2019d be weird skinny. I\u2019d be wrong if I was skinny. I\u2019m meant to be fat and I don\u2019t want to change it in any way!!! Being fat is part of my family\u2019s history. My grandpa, my genetic flesh and blood, survived WWII and immigrant camps and Ellis Island and his genetics said \u2018we will not let starvation happen again\u2019! I experienced child neglect and my body said \u2018we will not let starvation happen again\u2019! I\u2019m fat because my body loves me, because it said these terrible things will not happen again!!! I am fat because food makes me happy and I deserve to be happy! I deserve to eat wonderful things and as much of them as I want!!!  I\u2019m not fat because I don\u2019t care or I hate myself or my body is broken, I\u2019m fat because I\u2019m supposed to be. My body is fat. My body loves me and I love it right back. We work together, and we are happy together. We fight for each other. I will give my body the food it deserves and needs and it will give me the body I deserve and need. And that body happens to be fat!!! It is fat because of love, because of my family refusing to give up, because of my younger self refusing to give up. Because my mom worked so hard to make sure I could eat. Because I work so hard to make sure I can eat!!! Because food is tied to mental health, and my body and I are working very hard on that one!!! we are a team, and hating your team for things they can\u2019t control won\u2019t get you anywhere.  I am fat because my body loves me and wants me to survive no matter what. And not just survive, but thrive. To have good food. To get more sun on my skin. To look even better in my clothes. To have something to show for the hard work it does. My body is doing everything it can to keep me happy and safe and I am. Thank you body I\u2019m proud of us both. Eat if you\u2019re hungry. You deserve a snack. I\u2019m proud of you and you should be too. Your body loves you and is doing its best, you just have to try to appreciate its efforts. Millions of tiny cells work so hard to keep you going, and they all love you and want you to succeed. They\u2019re making the best version of you they can. You are the best version of you you can be right now. You will grow, you will change, and you will love yourself. If not today, then someday soon.",

Ffs its not lying if its to employers or cops and look up ur rights on what they can and cannot ask u many places ban asking about ur record and transportation status and things like that resources will also tell u how they reword sketchy questions so ur prepared \nHey. Take it from a former HR person\u2026 this goes double right now.  I just spent some time putting in some job applications myself (not for HR, lol) and got about 15 interviews. And idk if it\u2019s because of COVID uncertainty or if places just don\u2019t fucking care anymore because they know people are desperate for work, but the amount of straight up illegal shit\u00a0my interviewers asked me was appalling.  (That\u2019s not even counting the questions that were technically\u00a0legal but clearly fishing for information they\u2019re not legally allowed to ask.) A tame example? Two questions into a phone interview, the guy on the other end of the line asked:\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  I said\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d - giving him a chance to rethink that.  He didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  \u201cSir, you are not allowed to ask me that question.\u201d  \u201cWell, I want to know. I\u2019m asking.\u201d  \u201cAnd you\u2019re legally not allowed to ask me that. I\u2019m not required to tell you my age.\u201d  At that point, I guess he managed to remember an old HR bulletin or something (I hope to god he wasn\u2019t actually HR himself), and he said,\u00a0\u201cWell, I need to know if you\u2019re over the age of 18.\u201d (Which is what he should have asked in the first place\u2026 or not, since that was in the application that he could have read.)  \u201cYes. I\u2019m over the age of 18.\u201d\u00a0  And we moved on. Two questions later, he tried another illegal question. I called him on it again and ended the interview, citing that a workplace with such a clear disregard for the law, especially upon first contact with a potential employee, was not going to be a good fit. (They offered me the job anyway, lol. I didn\u2019t send a thank-you or a response.) At a different interview, the majority of questions were\u00a0\u201cfishing\u201d questions - just looking for that info they\u2019re not actually allowed to ask. (This person was also either not really HR or an HR person who was exceptionally bad at their job.) I could tell they were getting frustrated when I dodged answering the personal stuff, and they actually got extremely\u00a0upset when I mentioned later in the interview (re: less relevant work experience) I had worked in HR. They were super flustered for the remainder of our time, and I watched them skip over questions on their sheet they had clearly planned on asking. They KNEW they were being sketchy and were counting on me not knowing anything about HR - or my rights - and so they got upset when I did.  These were super tame\u00a0examples. I\u2019m begging you, if you\u2019re job searching right now, PLEASE\u00a0know your rights. Please know what interviewers are allowed to ask.  Please don\u2019t volunteer information or elaborate more than you\u2019re required to about personal things. Save your words (and everyone\u2019s time) by elaborating why you\u2019re good for the position/what you can do.  I may create a resource list on this shit later but PLEASE PLEASE KNOW THIS STUFF BEFORE YOU TALK TO AN EMPLOYER. This goes for anywhere you\u2019re interviewing as well as your current employer. This also goes for HR. HR may be the person you go to when shitty stuff happens, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re your friend (or competent).  They don\u2019t need to know your age (beyond 16+, 18+, or 21+, depending on the job). They don\u2019t need to know your medical history. (For the love of god, do NOT answer the\u00a0\u201chave you been diagnosed with depression?\u201d question.) They don\u2019t need to know if you have kids or whatever. They don\u2019t need to know a LOT of those things that may appear on an application, including your veteran status, whether you\u2019re on/have been on unemployment, etc. They\u2019re not entitled to know specifics about your transportation (unless you\u2019re using that transportation for the job, like Uber/delivery drivers). Look this up for your state/the job\u2019s state.  Beware questions like\u00a0\u201cWhat year did you graduate?\u201d if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t put dates on your resume (I just put amount of time spent at employers, not dates of employment). They\u2019re fishing for your age. It\u2019s \u201cOh, you know, 100 years ago,\u201d if you feel comfortable making a joke, or\u00a0\u201cAbout [generic number, like 5 or 10] years ago\u201d if not.  Also beware things like the\u00a0\u201cWhat do you do in your free time?\u201d question, even if you already work there. This is not a friendly getting-to-know-you question. This is a basis for judgement. Not up to an invisible standard? They\u2019re going to be biased against you for pay raises, promotions, etc. Mention kids/lots of family/social engagements? That\u2019s a tick against you for not being the kind of person who lives to work (yes, it\u2019s gross and stupid). Mention lots of solitary things? Cool, that\u2019s their mental note to ask more from you because you\u2019re\u00a0\u201cnot doing anything anyway.\u201d By all means, be friendly with your coworkers/talk about shared interests if you want, but it is none\u00a0of your boss\u2019s business, and be aware what could get back to them.\u00a0  Don\u2019t. Tell. Employers. Shit.   \nWe wrote up a handy list of those illegal questions here: 10 Questions You Should Never Be Asked in a Job Interview\u00a0 \n\n\nHopefully people already know this by now, but I saw way too often back when I worked in retail. Don\u2019t add your coworkers or boss on social media. Yes, your coworkers too. You don\u2019t want to accidentally say something to them or have them see a post and mention it to your boss. I\u2019ve seen it happen.",

He tried to appear confident, but his concern was noticeable   \"Hey... Whatever is upsetling you... Pon... You don't have to talk about it if you don't want, pon. At least company would help, pon?\" What Fal can do? What? Dotty lowers themself and hides their face under their wing.  \"It's not your problem. I got in an argument, that's all.\" Fal murmured an \"ohh\" in response. Hesitantly he looked away and then looked back at Dotty. One of his tassels rested on Dotty's head, trying to give a bit of comfort \"You're right that's not Fal problem, but  that isn't going to stop Fal, pon. If Fal can do anything, just say it. Or even if you don't want nothing, that's ok too. The point is that Fal isn't going to leave, pon\" \"I thought so.\" Dotty sighs. \"Fine, then. Make yourself comfortable.\" At those words, Fal seemed to relax, although his concern was still notable. Fal resumed flight and circled in the air, scattering sparks. Although his movements were playful, his face remained blank. Perhaps what Fal perceived as \"comfortable\" was spinning in the air? If that was the case, it was quite childish, even for an AI Shyly, Fal tried to cheer up Dotty with some topic of interest. Fal would not ask or pressure them \"... Do you... Have any hobbies, pon? Like... Star gazing, drawing, gardening or anything, pon?\" Fal asked while he was floating upside down This is alright? Or Fal is just making things worse? \"I like drawing. I guess. Sometimes I draw in my spare time.\" \"I also like... going outside, when I can.\" Dotty mumbles, their face buried under their wing.  \"Pon... Wait, how can you draw if you don't have hands, pon? Drawing is already a difficult skill to master, and well... That makes it more complicated, pon! \" \u201c\u2026I use my talon\u2026\u201d Dotty looks a bit embarrassed. Fal nodded slowly at the answer. Seeing Dotty's reaction, he thought that perhaps he had been reckless. This was doable, and after somersaulting in the air he landed on the floor. More sparkles and stars flew around, some of them \"sticking\" to Dotty for a few seconds before disappearing. Maybe they just want silence? That would EVIDENTLY be the most logical thing. Fal thought that talking about something in particular would help, but maybe he was just acting without thinking, again Fal stood next to Dotty in complete silence. He wanted to ask several things, he wanted to help them, but again if he forced them to act or talk when it was obvious that they didn't want to, it would only aggravate the situation. For this reason, Fal held the words in his mouth and his tail surrounded Dotty but did not touch them  Dotty stayed silent.  They wanted someone to talk to. They had so much on their mind - too much. Way too much. But they didn't know how to ask, or how to begin. They weren't sure how to ask for help, but it's not like they needed help, right? \"...I got in a fight, if you're curious.\" \"Not... anything physical. It was over the phone.\" Fal turned to look at Dotty, brimming with concern at their words \"What!? You got into a fight, pon!? Tell Fal it wasn't with the people that are hunting you, pon! Or someone else wanted to harm you, pon!?\" \"It wasn't like that. It was an argument with someone at home.\"  \"Those guys are... those guys are no biggie. I can deal with them.\" \"... Pon... Even if those guys aren't the \"biggie\" as you said... More important! You can trust Fal and talk about it... Only if you want, pon... Fal isn't going to pressure, pon. Take your time or... Well, it's obvious that this doesn't have nothing to do with Fal... Fal understand that this is not of Fal's concern... But still! Fal want to support you as much as possible, pon!\" \u201cAnd by \u2018support,\u2019 you mean \u2018not leaving me alone.\u2019\u201d Which was okay, actually.  Shut up. \u201cI guess I could use someone to talk to right now.\u201d \"Well, Fal learned that standing there for others help, pon. Take the time you need to talk... If you regret, Fal will understand that don't you feel comfortable or ready to let it out, pon\" Who would feel comfortable talking about that? \"...Okay.\" Dotty raises their head from their wing, still looking away from Fal.  \"It involves Doc and a friend of mine, Wolfbell.\" Dotty takes a deep breath. Tries to hide the pain in their voice.  \"Doc tried to experiment on Wolfbell. And she agreed to it... without telling me. And when she did tell me, it was already too late. So Doc and I had an argument. And as usual, he won.\u201d \u201cI just... I can never win. I can never win against him.\" Dotty's words disconcerted Fal, who was completely paralyzed. He remembers that person, Wolfbell... And the Dark Matter thag tried to... Eat him He recognized the rarity that Wolfbell is, but Fal recognized that she is a living being. She's just a child! Hearing how someone... Even for someone with a thirst for knowledge like Fal, that's crossing the line And the argument...  Seriously, how many deja vu Fal has already?  Fal understood that. Maybe it wasn't exactly the same, but he could definitely relate \"... Even for someone with a thirst for knowledge, that's crossing the line... Maybe Fal is not in the right, and you can correct Fal if that's the case, pon. Does he always end up winning by bringing up something against you, pon? Or do they measure their words in such a way that you end up being a pawn on their chess board, pon?\" That was too much... \"... The point is: This \"Doc\" sounds like that kind of person... Although Fal always had wrong ideas about people, pon\" Snow White used to say that Fal was being dramatic. Several people came to Fal because he needed to apologize to Shade, as if he was not a danger and more like an injured child \"When we get into arguments at home, Doc always uses the same excuse: everything he does, he does to protect me. And when I point out that it isn't true, he brings up... something that I don't like talking about. And he always wins.\" \"That's playing dirty... Fal recognise that there are people who would do everything for what they care about, but... Pon...\" Fal hesitated for a few seconds before sighing nervously. His tail surrounded Dotty and brought them close to his body, like if he was giving them a hug. Fal stumbled over his words, but finally managed to let go of what he had \"P-Protecting others is important, but THAT is not the way, pon...\" \"I just... I want to leave. I want to run away from him.\" \"But... Where will you go, pon...?\" Maybe they could go with Fal? That doesn't sound like a good idea, fish \"I don't know. I'll probably just live on my own.\" \"... There's nothing that can make you change your mind, right, pon?\" Fal sigh \"... Fal isn't going to stop you, pon... But think carefully about it... Would you, pon?\" \u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind. I want to leave. I\u2019m not coming back home, not to him. If he won\u2019t look at me, I\u2019ll stop wanting him to. I\u2019ll find someone else out in the big, \u2018dangerous\u2019 world. All I need is a plan.\u201d \"... There's a reason why he is like that or not, pon? And... Finding someone else... It wouldn't be so easy, pon... Until then... Dotty... you know how to make a meal by your own, pon?\" Fal said that he wasn't going to stop them. However, he feelt the urge to be against his own words. The thing with being a wandered was how you managed to survive with someone or alone... At least that's what Fal learned But over all of that was the mental health They can handle the loneliness if they can't find a place to stay? \"... And what about the people that are hunting you, pon?\" \"You know, I know how to do more things than most people think. I've had to take care of Doc sometimes. Which he never acknowledges. But hey, when I've gone away, maybe he'll finally notice me. Or, the lack of me.\" The idea of \u200b\u200bleaving someone behind upset Fal but this person Dotty was talking about was anything except nice, at least in their own words. Going to the point of running away is proof of that!  But Fal was lost. What should Fal do? Part of him supported them while the other didn't want that  He don't have an answer  Fal shuddered at this thought. Fal had no answer. How? Fal is a Waiter! Obviously he had to have an answer! He just... Needs to think calmly  Fal separated from Dotty and resumed floating. He seemed deep in thought but spared a glance at Dotty \"...That... Fal guess it's good, at least the experience was of some use, right, pon? On a more serious note... Please think about it calmly. You can also count on with Fal for anything, pon\" \"I will. I'll give it some thought. Th... thanks.\" \"You're a good friend.\" Upon hearing the words \"good friend\" Fal smiled. His constellations shone with its emotion  So, the feeling is mutual!  The others always told him that he didn't require verbal confirmation to know if someone was his friend... Fal considered almost all of these new faces as friends... But for them to see him as a friend... Is an topic aside that is falling on THEIR criteria, not Fal's \"Well... You're a good friend too! Ignoring this burning of course. How do you feel, pon?\" \"Actually, I feel better, now that I've talked to you.\" \"That's good, pon! Now... Oh, right the another reason why Fal is here... Remember the things that Fal said when you brought Gizmo's visor, pon?\" \"What about it? I still have it, by the way.\" \"Well, Fal wanted to clarify something. Many times the answers are not to the listener's liking and Fal recognizes that perhaps it was a bit exaggerated to say that you are the result of some type of artificial selection, pon. Fal definitely does not know species with the name \"Type 2 Canary\" but it could well be something else and Fal simply does not know what it is,pon\" Was he making excuses? No, Fal felt that his chatter was a bit crude. Furthermore, he had been told many, many times that he cannot always know everything. Still, he hates having to come up and say, \"I was just giving crazy ideas, okay?\" Well, it's the same as saying that he was shuffling thoughts and not concrete things Fal looked at Dotty with intrigue... Seriously now is not the time to ask for that. Dotty is the priority right now \"... This is... Yeah, like an apologize for that rambling, pon\" \"Yeah. It was an exaggeration. I think. If anyone tried to breed my species for anything important, they failed.\"  Dotty chuckles. Still, Dotty couldn't help but wonder what \"Type 2 Canary\" even meant. Canaries are a type of bird, aren't they? But they aren't a bird. Maybe they're a bird hybrid? There are a lot of species with bird-like traits that aren't birds. And what about \"Type 1 Canaries?\" Does a Type 1 even exist? Hey, what was that saying again? Something about canaries in -- Ugh. They're starting to sound like Doc.   \"I wonder what a 'Type 2 Canary' even is...\" \"Well... You find out something, even if it's cryptic it's better than nothing, pon! Besides the answers will come sooner or later... And... That Doc... Fuck up the Doc, pon!\" It was REALLY odd to hear Fal insulting someone just like that Dotty looked at Fal, shocked, before cracking up into laughter. \u201cWow!! I never thought you were even capable of cursing!!\u201d \u201cYeah, fuck him. I can live on my own. I don\u2019t need him, right?\u201d \"Ohh believe Fal, there are many things you don't know about Fal, pon...\" Fal smiled with a hint of malice and turned in the air until he was face down. The constellations around him reunited to form a mini Dotty that greeted the gremlin. The mini Dotty encourage the original Dotty and they show their wing like if they were saying: \"Come on high five!\" \"Fal can't answer that, pon. Maybe Fal insult him, but Fal doesn't know him like you do, pon... But keep in mind that these kinds of decisions are complicated... Be careful with your steps, pon\" Dotty high-fives (or high-ones?) Fal with their wing talon.  \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll be careful. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d Fal did a somersault in the air again at the same time that the mini Dotty disappeared after receiving that high-one. Fal stood up and using one of his tassels of his scarf gave Dotty a very light blow on the head as he looked at them disapprovingly \"You are a friend. Even when Fal admits that Fal was scared of you, that was just at the beginning! Besides, can you call a relationship \"friendly\" if one doesn't care about the other, pon? Fal understand that you want freedoms... That Doc doesn't seem like the type to trust easily on the person he should take care of... Anyway... Fal want to stay, but there are things Fal have to do. However, Fal will always be available to talk if you need it, pon! Oh, and Dotty when you can... Could you try using that visor on Fal one day? of course, only when you are available, pon!\" \"Sure.  \"And speaking of visors... don't you have your own? What if...\"  Dotty points at Fal's goggles, then at themself.  \"First of all, Fal can't scan Fal. The goggles don't work on mirrors and same goes for the creations of the Dimensional Mirror, pon. Second... You're referring that Fal tries to scan you, pon?\" \"Yeah. Why not?\" Fal was hesitant at the idea but quickly dispelled his doubts. Dotty wasn't like them, right? They just gave off those vibes... Plus, it would be a good opportunity to learn more about them. Maybe it would be a waste of time but he also wanted answers. There's nothing to loose if he try. Fal did another somersault in the air, and when he stopped he had his goggles on \"Alright, here we go, pon!\" \nDotty had been excited to find out their past.  Emphasis on \"had been.\"  Now, with disappointment after disappointment, and with so many other things to deal with, they didn't care as much anymore.  But still... they were curious. So they stood in front of Fal and waited.",

        "summary": "Reflecting on the Tragedy: The Loss of Elon Musk\u2019s Son to the \u201cWoak Minds Virus\u201dThe tech world was shaken to its core by the heart-wrenching news of Elon Musk\u2019s son\u2019s death, attributed to the so-called \u201cwoak minds virus,\u201d a term not medically recognized but metaphorically representing a tragedy that has sparked widespread attention and discussion. Elon Musk, a figure synonymous with groundbreaking ventures in technology and space exploration, faced an unimaginable grief, casting a somber shadow over his futuristic endeavors. The public\u2019s response to Musk\u2019s personal loss was a complex tapestry of sympathy, concern, and a heightened awareness around mental health and societal pressures.The \u201cWoak Minds Virus\u201d: A Brief OverviewWhile the term \u201cwoak minds virus\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to a biological pathogen, it metaphorically captures a societal and mental health crisis. This concept has been discussed in relation to the increasing pressures and polarizations within society that adversely affect mental health, especially among the youth. The tragedy that befell Musk\u2019s son underscores the urgent need for a dialogue on the mental well-being of individuals navigating the complexities of modern life.Timeline of Events and the Ripple EffectThe exact timeline leading to this tragic event remains private, out of respect for the family\u2019s grief. However, the aftermath saw a burgeoning public discourse on the impacts of social pressures exacerbated by the digital age. Media coverage extended beyond the incident itself to broader concerns about mental health, particularly in technology and social media circles, spotlighting the relentless pace and expectations placed on individuals in these high-stakes environments.Musk\u2019s Public Statements and ActionsIn the wake of this personal tragedy, Elon Musk\u2019s responses were measured and focused on broader societal implications. His statements and actions post-tragedy emphasized the importance of supporting mental health, understanding the risks associated with the digital and social media landscapes, and fostering a more empathetic society. Musk\u2019s resolve to address these issues reflects a commitment to ensuring that the tech industry, often criticized for its relentless pace and insensitivity to individual well-being, takes concrete steps toward a healthier work-life balance and mental health support for its constituents. \n\n\n\nImplications for Mental Health Awareness and the Tech IndustryThis tragic event has catalyzed important conversations around mental health awareness and the responsibility of the tech industry in safeguarding the well-being of its workers and users. The dialogue has expanded to include the role of social media in shaping societal norms and pressures, the importance of mental health support systems, and the need for a collective effort to destigmatize mental health issues. As we move forward, the legacy of this tragedy must be one of increased empathy, understanding, and action towards creating a society where mental well-being is a priority, and support is readily available for all.",

        "summary": "methed-up-marxist: \u201cThe study that had the most direct impact on the psychiatric profession\u2014 as well as public consciousness\u2014at this time was David Rosenhan\u2019s (1973) classic research On Being Sane in Insane Places which found that psychiatrists could not distinguish between \u201creal\u201d and \u201cpseudo\u201d patients presenting at psychiatric hospitals in the United States. All of Rosenhan\u2019s \u201cpseudo\u201d patients (college students/researchers involved in the experiment) were admitted and given a psychotic label, and all the subsequent behaviour of the researchers\u2014including their note-taking\u2014was labelled by staff as further symptoms of their disorder (for a summary, see Burstow 2015: 75-76). This research was a culmination of earlier studies on labelling and mental illness which had begun in the 1960s with Irving Goffman (1961) and Thomas Scheff (1966). Goffman\u2019s (1961) ethnographic study of psychiatric incarceration demonstrated many of the features which Rosenhan\u2019s study would later succinctly outline, including the arbitrary nature of psychiatric assessment, the labelling of patient behaviour as further evidence of \u201cmental illness,\u201d and the processes of institutional conformity by which the inmates learned to accept such labels if they wanted to have any chance of being released from the institution at a later date. Scheffs (1966) work on diagnostic decision making in psychiatry formulated a general labelling theory for the sociology of mental health. Again, his research found that psychiatrists made arbitrary and subjective decisions on those designated as \u201cmentally ill,\u201d sometimes retaining people in institutions even when there was no evidence to support such a decision. Psychiatrists, he argued, relied on a common sense set of beliefs and practices rather than observable, scientific evidence. Scheff (1966) concluded that the labelling of a person with a \u201cmental illness\u201d was contingent on the violation of social norms by low-status rule-breakers who are judged by higher status agents of social control (in this case, the psychiatric profession). Thus, according to these studies, the nature of \u201cmental illness\u201d is not a fixed object of medical study but rather a form of \u201csocial deviance\u201d\u2014a moral marker of societal infraction by the powerful inflicted on the powerless.\u201d -Bruce Cohen, Psychiatric Hegemony, 2016",

We are parents to five children:\u00a0Yazan\u00a0(12),\u00a0Fadl\u00a0(11),\u00a0Zina\u00a0(10),\u00a0Rajaa\u00a0(7), and our baby girl\u00a0Basma, who is just a year and a half old. My lovely family   Donate to Support Fatima\u2019s Family in Gaza After Heartbreaking Tragedy, organized by Fatima Alanqar We live in Tal AlHawa, Gaza. In the early days of the war,\u00a0we were forced to flee our home after it was completely destroyed by occupation forces with fire and missiles.\u00a0Our car was also burned\u00a0down to a heap of metal, and all our\u00a0clothes were burned\u00a0too. We have been\u00a0displaced 17 times, each time escaping death by a miracle. We walked long distances on foot with our children who struggled to keep up, driven by fear to escape danger. After years of effort and construction for our house, then one day and one night everything vanished   My children\u2019s mental health has been shattered.\u00a0They have suffered immensely from fear, displacement, and homelessness, with barely enough food and water to feed a small cat. They have endured\u00a0carrying water over long distances\u00a0throughout the day, surrounded by destruction, rockets, and shrapnel. They were deprived of continuing their education, despite being top students. One of those times when we had to sleep in our previously destroyed house, a missile landed on us and, by God\u2019s grace, it did not explode.   My children have been deprived of the food\u00a0they love and need for their bodies and minds to grow, enduring constant fear and terror day and night for 10 months without any peace or rest. We also contracted many diseases, including\u00a0hepatitis and skin infections\u00a0due to the lack of water and hygiene supplies in overcrowded shelters and sometimes in our destroyed home :( . We were also forced to stay completely still for periods ranging from\u00a03 to 7 days due to the ongoing siege, drinking\u00a0contaminated water\u00a0out of fear of the tanks around us. Our car was not spared from the bombing either   The children\u2019s rooms were completely burned\u2026     Some members of my family were\u00a0martyred, and others were\u00a0injured.\u00a0Fear, crying, and sadness fill the place. We once had all the comforts and basic tools for a decent life, but now we have lost everything. We cook our food over open fires despite the exhaustion and heat, and we\u00a0barely manage to get flour, water, and firewood. Yet we remain resilient in northern Gaza despite the bombing, hunger, and severe shortages of water, medicine, and necessary supplies. And now, that\u2019s all we have   I was even forced to wean my  year-and-a-half-old daughter due to the lack of milk :( . We are displaced and homeless, continuously moving from one place to another until this dreadful war ends. My heart breaks for her\u2026. : We are in desperate need of your help.\u00a0We invite you to contribute to this fund to save my family and provide us with a safe shelter, food, water, and healthcare for all of us.\u00a0Please share\u00a0our story with your friends and family to raise awareness and support.\u00a0Your words and prayers\u00a0give us the strength to endure these difficult circumstances.

To begin our story, it is important to introduce my family, who are the core of my existence and the source of my strength during these turbulent times:   We are a family of four suffering for over 9 months from a brutal war that spares neither humans nor stones.   Mother: The Heart of Our Home My mother embodies generosity and kindness as a devoted homemaker, always prioritizing her family\u2019s well-being. Her unwavering love remains our sanctuary amidst the chaos.   Father: The Pillar of Strength My father, Majed, a dedicated professor, faced the destruction of the university he served. Despite this, his commitment to education and society remains unshaken.   Brother: A Beacon of Healing My brother, Mohammad, a compassionate doctor, confronts the challenges of healthcare amidst dwindling supplies and occupation brutality, showcasing remarkable dedication to healing.     Tamer: A Dream Deferred As for myself, Tamer, I was on the verge of a new beginning, with aspirations to further my career in Germany. I had saved thousands of dollars for the mandatory block account to support my stay abroad. However, the conflict has not only shattered my professional dreams but also consumed what didn\u2019t burn of my savings, compelling me to fight for my family\u2019s survival amidst the escalating costs of basic human necessities.

But unfortunately, this was just the beginning. We have been displaced four times in the same southern area, fleeing from death always surrounding us.   Initially, we fled to a school belonging to the UNRWA in the Nuseirat camp until we were forced to move to another area, and the Maghazi camp was the intended destination. Then a UNRWA school, where we were residing in a tent inside, was targeted, killing 7 civilians. We were forced to flee again to a tent in Rafah, but the scarcity of clean water and the spread of epidemics and diseases forced us to flee again to a UNRWA school in the Deir Al-Balah area until now.   UNRWA has been providing refuge to hundreds of displaced families for the past six months at schools that have become vital community hubs, offering shelter to thousands of individuals trapped in the southern region. Women and children sleep inside classrooms, and the men sleep outside in tents set up in the courtyard. Rainstorms recently have flooded our tents, and it\u2019s very difficult to take care of our basic needs.   [Pictures of Tamer after the war in the UNRWA school and his tent]             I am currently volunteering at Al-Aqsa Hospital, assisting in the maxillofacial surgery department. However, a sense of helplessness and despair often overwhelms me. It\u2019s hard to put into words the horrors and injuries I witness daily.

This report delves into the key drivers, trends, and future outlook of the caffeine substitute market, highlighting its dynamic nature and potential for continued expansion. In this detailed analysis, we will explore the factors contributing to the market's growth, the impact of consumer behavior, regulatory influences, and the role of industry innovation. Drivers of the\u00a0Caffeine Substitute Market\u00a0Health and Wellness AwarenessOne of the primary drivers propelling the caffeine substitute market is the growing awareness and consciousness regarding health and wellness. As consumers increasingly seek healthier lifestyles, their focus has shifted to diet and beverage choices.  Browse over XX market data Figures spread through\u00a0XX Pages and an in-depth TOC on\u00a0the \"Global\u00a0Caffeine Substitute Market\u201d @\u00a0https://www.techsciresearch.com/report/caffeine-substitute-market/21688.html\u00a0\u00a0   Traditional caffeinated products, such as coffee and energy drinks, have come under scrutiny due to potential health risks like increased heart rate, anxiety, digestive issues, and dependency. This scrutiny has led consumers to explore alternatives that offer similar benefits without the associated drawbacks, creating a significant market opportunity for caffeine substitutes. Products marketed as healthier and natural alternatives, such as herbal teas, chicory root coffee, and yerba mate, are gaining traction among health-conscious consumers. Lifestyle-Related Health ConcernsThe prevalence of lifestyle-related health concerns, including stress, anxiety, and sleep disorders, has contributed to the rising demand for caffeine substitutes. Modern lifestyles, characterized by long working hours, high-stress levels, and irregular sleep patterns, drive consumers to seek solutions that provide sustained energy and mental alertness without adverse effects. Caffeine substitutes, often formulated with adaptogens and herbal ingredients like ashwagandha, ginseng, and valerian root, are positioned as solutions to address these health concerns while offering a natural and holistic approach to well-being. Additionally, these products often boast additional benefits such as improved digestion, enhanced immune support, and better sleep quality, making them attractive to a broad audience. Market Trends of\u00a0Caffeine Substitutes\u00a0Clean Label and Organic ProductsThe demand for clean label and organic products is a prevailing trend in the caffeine substitute market. Consumers are increasingly scrutinizing product labels and seeking transparency in ingredient sourcing and processing. Manufacturers respond by formulating substitutes with natural, organic, and non-GMO ingredients, tapping into the growing preference for products perceived as healthier and more environmentally friendly. This trend is further fueled by the rising consumer awareness of the environmental impact of conventional farming practices and the benefits of sustainable agriculture. Organic caffeine substitutes, free from pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, are gaining popularity for their perceived purity and health benefits. Additionally, brands are emphasizing minimal processing and natural extraction methods to maintain the integrity and efficacy of their ingredients. Rise of E-Commerce and Direct-to-Consumer ChannelsThe rise of e-commerce and direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels has transformed the distribution landscape for caffeine substitutes. Consumers are increasingly turning to online platforms to discover and purchase niche products that may not be readily available in traditional retail outlets. This shift allows smaller brands to reach a wider audience and provides consumers with convenient access to a diverse range of caffeine substitute options. The e-commerce model also enables brands to engage directly with consumers, gather valuable feedback, and tailor their offerings to meet specific needs. Subscription services for caffeine substitutes are also gaining popularity, offering consumers the convenience of regular deliveries and personalized product recommendations. This trend is supported by the proliferation of health and wellness blogs, social media influencers, and digital marketing campaigns that raise awareness and educate consumers about the benefits of caffeine substitutes. Market SegmentationBy TypeBased on type, the organic segment is the fastest-growing in the caffeine substitute market. Rising consumer demand for healthier and more natural products drives this trend. Increasing awareness of the potential side effects of caffeine and a growing preference for products without synthetic chemicals further boost this segment. Organic caffeine substitutes, such as herbal teas, grain-based coffee alternatives, and adaptogenic beverages, are perceived as healthier and more environmentally friendly. The global push towards sustainable and organic farming practices also supports this growth. Marketing efforts highlighting the health benefits, purity, and eco-friendliness of organic products accelerate their popularity in the caffeine substitute market. Furthermore, the inclusion of superfoods and nutrient-dense ingredients in organic formulations is attracting health-conscious consumers seeking functional benefits. By PackagingThe packaging of caffeine substitutes also plays a crucial role in their market appeal. Consumers prefer eco-friendly and sustainable packaging options, aligning with the broader trend towards environmental consciousness. Innovative packaging solutions that preserve product freshness and quality while minimizing environmental impact are gaining traction. Biodegradable, compostable, and recyclable packaging materials are being adopted by brands to meet consumer expectations and regulatory requirements. Additionally, the design and aesthetics of packaging are important in attracting consumers, with clean, minimalist, and informative labels being favored. Packaging that highlights key product attributes, such as organic certification, non-GMO status, and functional benefits, can significantly influence purchasing decisions. By Distribution ChannelThe distribution channel segment is diverse, with e-commerce, health food stores, supermarkets, and specialty stores being key players. The convenience and variety offered by online platforms make e-commerce a dominant distribution channel, especially for niche and premium products. Health food stores and supermarkets also remain important, catering to consumers seeking in-person shopping experiences and immediate product access. Specialty stores, such as organic markets and wellness boutiques, provide curated selections of caffeine substitutes, appealing to discerning consumers.

North America and Europe are prominent markets due to high health awareness and a strong inclination towards natural and organic products. The Asia-Pacific region is emerging as a lucrative market, driven by a growing middle class, increasing disposable incomes, and a shift towards healthier lifestyles. Latin America and the Middle East & Africa are also witnessing gradual growth, supported by rising health consciousness and expanding retail infrastructure. Each region has unique consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes, which influence market dynamics.

To begin our story, it is important to introduce my family, who are the core of my existence and the source of my strength during these turbulent times: My only son, Youssef: is a wonderful and very intelligent child. However, from the age of one, he has been suffering from esophageal varices, which is the swelling of the veins in the esophagus. This condition causes him to vomit blood, which can be fatal if not treated urgently. Youssef\u2019s condition is what forced me to start this campaign to save him from death and to enable his treatment.   My husband Samer:  a very ambitious young man who loves life, works as an English teacher. We have a company for bodybuilding supplements.  It was the largest and most successful company in the Gaza Strip, but due to the war, it has been completely destroyed and damaged, and the goods inside were stolen. The goods are worth millions of shekels.       I am Deema, the mother: I work as a pharmacist in my modest pharmacy. A month before the war, I had started studying for a master\u2019s degree in healthcare management, but the university was destroyed, the pharmacy was destroyed, and life and hope were shattered.   We are a family of three suffering for over 9 months from a brutal war that spares neither humans nor stones.  We have lost our home with all its dreams and memories. A two-floor house completely leveled to the ground!!    [Pictures of the destroyed house]     Since the beginning of the war, we were forced to flee our home in the north of the Gaza Strip to the supposed safe area in the south. But unfortunately, this was just the beginning. We have been displaced four times in the same southern area, fleeing from death always surrounding us \u2026until we ended up in tents and living the tent life. Now we hope to escape death, we hope for the end of the war, we hope to leave the Gaza Strip, and we hope to live a decent life away from bombing, occupation, and destruction. These efforts are all aimed at saving my child\u2019s life and securing urgent treatment for him.It has been 9 months of hell and horror. This genocide has been too long to bear, and our mental health and lives are in constant danger. (I can\u2019t describe enough what I have been dealing with daily in the hospitals for the past days. We have reached a point where there is no hope left for us here in Gaza, where we are unfortunately just waiting for our turn to die, and even if there is a ceasefire, the destruction in Gaza is beyond prompt repair    Evacuation fees are expensive, especially now that I have no source of income. Once we can evacuate, your donations will cover our travel expenses and help us get immediate support in Egypt. There will be meal expenses, wardrobe expenses, emergency expenses, etc., but no generous contribution will go to waste.   To cross the \u201cRafah\u201d Gaza-Egypt Borders, you need to have your name listed in the Crossing List (paid permit), and coordinators in Egypt who have the power to add my family\u2019s names to the list at the border are now asking for anywhere from $5000 per PERSON! They will not add the names until we can prove we have the money ready. ask for your help because this is not just my battle alone, but a battle in which we seek your helping hand to survive and preserve our families. Any donation, big or small, will have a huge impact on the lives of my family and me. I am grateful to everyone who donates, and I will remain grateful forever for giving hope and opportunity to me and my family to survive and build a better future. Thank you for reading my story. For sharing my story with your friends and family. I hope, there is a ceasefire, and we can get the rest and safety we deserve to build our lives all over again. \u2764\ufe0f   Donate to Help Save My Son Yousef, organized by Kamel Shahwan This campaign has been verified and documented @90-ghost @whompthatsucker1981",

Welcome to Midnight Mania! \nThere\u2019s a little extra money on the line at UFC 304. \nDuring the UFC 304 press conference on Thursday (July 25, 2024), Lightweight contender Bobby \u201cKing\u201d Green made a request to UFC CEO Dana White, asking that he double up the usual $50k performance bonuses. After some cheers from the crowd and confirmation from Welterweight champion Leon Edwards, White agreed to the request. \nThis isn\u2019t the first time the bonuses have been bumped in 2024. Back at UFC 300, Justin Gaethje and others campaigned for $300k performance bonuses and were ultimately granted their wish. Max Holloway was the big winner that night, as his double dip earned him an extra $600k in bonus money! \nUFC 304 isn\u2019t quite as high-profile as UFC 300, but nobody is arguing with an extra $50k. Well, there was still one small bit of negativity, as Edwards made sure to remind his opponent, Belal Muhammad, that there was no chance of \u201cThe Bully\u201d getting any of that extra dough. As Muhammad cheered for the raise, Edwards interjected, \u201cBelal don\u2019t worry about that, you\u2019re knocking no one out!\u201d \nFunny enough, both Edwards and Muhammad have each scored just two performance bonuses across their entire careers. Muhammad is actually in the lead, however, as he also scored a \u201cFight of the Night\u201d bonus in his UFC debut, and he technically knocked out an opponent more recently than Edwards! \nWe\u2019ll see how it all plays out on Saturday night.",

        "summary": "It\u2019s not as if other fighters hadn\u2019t recovered. But when featherweight amateur boxing legend Vasiliy Lomachenko yanked his shoulder out of his socket in 2018, he thought his career was over. It was devastating, not only for his physical health, but for his mental state too. Dug into the recesses of his own head, Lomachenko tricked himself into thinking he would never throw another punch again. But his doctor, the infamous LA pseudo-celebrity, Neal ElAttrache knew he would. A high profile surgeon and caretaker for professional athletes and LA celebs, ElAttrache had a history of reshaping his clients\u2019 mental perceptions of their health before even performing the surgery. A unique approach \u2013 but a timely one, as well. Many times throughout his infamous Dialogues, Plato believed that one could not heal the parts without healing the whole. For a healthy body without a healthy mind, without a healthy subconscious, was nothing more than simply \u201ca collection of the parts.\u201d In Alcibiades, Plato\u2019s depiction of Socrates says it best: \u201cFor if a man, my dear Alcibiades, is at liberty to do what he pleases, but is lacking in mind, what is the probable result to him personally, or to the state as well?\u201d And it seems as if ElAttrache found the answer to Socrates\u2019 question \u2013 failure (and for athletes, more time away from the sport). In an age in which mental health is consistently destigmatized, ElAttrache seems to have found another route into perhaps the most pressing medical issue of our time, especially for male athletes as Lomachenko. If one could fix the mind before they could fix the body, they had done the grunt work, the largest climb of the Sisyphean mountain of recovery. \u201cFor it is not enough to have a good mind,\u201d Descartes says, as \u201cthe main thing is to use it well.\u201d A day before his similarly devastating shoulder surgery in 2015, Kobe Bryant was putting up shots in a private gym. The gym\u2019s owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, reprimanded him, shocked at the strain he was putting on an already injured rotator cuff. But Kobe, working under ElAttrache\u2019s new system, already knew better. \u201cIt\u2019s broken. Neal\u2019s going to fix it tomorrow anyways.\u201d Thanks for reading!

        "summary": "As the fall semester approaches, the University of Minnesota offers several counseling services for students struggling with their mental health. \nBoynton Health and Student Counseling Services (SCS) at the University each provide counseling options uniquely tailored to students. This allows students to receive the kind of care they need through the University, so long as they are willing to undergo the process. \nThough there are differences between Boynton Mental Health and SCS, they operate under the same \u201cmental health umbrella,\u201d according to the Office for Student Affairs. \nPsychotherapist and Associate Director of Boynton Clinic Cecelia Bloomquist said the first step for students seeking counseling services at Boynton is to set up a mental health consultation. She said this is usually a 30-minute appointment where the student can speak with a mental health professional, express concerns and explain what kind of service they are looking for. \n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of our point of entry,\u201d Bloomquist said. \nThe goal of this appointment is to gain a high-level understanding of what is happening with the student so the mental health professional can find the right service for them, Bloomquist said. These appointments can be scheduled over the phone or through Boynton\u2019s online portal, launched last year to improve accessibility to mental health resources. \nBloomquist said people can typically get in for a consultation at Boynton within two weeks, with better availability during the summer. Following the consultation, students make one-on-one appointments to see a professional. \nAccording to Bloomquist, the busiest times of year for Boynton counseling coincide with midterms and final exams in both spring and fall semesters. She said these are the times in which stress levels are higher, causing an increase in demand for service and possibly longer wait times. \nBoynton has struggled with technology issues on its website in the past, Bloomquist said, which has prevented students from seeing all open appointments online. Though she said Boynton is working diligently to resolve these issues, for now, it can lead to miscommunication on accessibility. \nSCS Staff Psychologist and Outreach Coordinator Jake Loeffler said SCS has similar peak times. He added the student\u2019s availability impacts how quickly they will match with an SCS mental health professional.",

But forget about all that (I could talk for a long time about the respect I have for Sam Reich)\u2014ignore just how respectable he is as a businessman and a person. Ignore all the wholesome reasons for obsessing over Sam Dalton Reich.  The man is a stone-cold fox. He\u2019s a little chaos gremlin and an absolute evil mastermind all rolled into one classy suit and well-groomed beard. Whenever Sam is on the set, you can guarantee he is going to make you crack a smile. And for someone with such natural authority, he\u2019s never afraid to be the butt of a joke and show himself being embarrassed. Go ahead, watch any clip of him trying to improvise in No Laugh Newsroom and just try to resist that blush.  You\u2019re sleeping on a goldmine of a man, here, damnit! And I will NOT let this go ignored any longer!",

[Picture of Tamer before the war in his clinic]     I have hesitated and delayed for a long time to write these words and create an account on GoFundMe, but the need has become very urgent due to what I see of death approaching myself and my family.   To begin our story, it is important to introduce my family, who are the core of my existence and the source of my strength during these turbulent times:   We are a family of four suffering for over 9 months from a brutal war that spares neither humans nor stones.   Mother: The Heart of Our Home My mother embodies generosity and kindness as a devoted homemaker, always prioritizing her family\u2019s well-being. Her unwavering love remains our sanctuary amidst the chaos.   Father: The Pillar of Strength My father, Majed, a dedicated professor, faced the destruction of the university he served. Despite this, his commitment to education and society remains unshaken.   Brother: A Beacon of Healing My brother, Mohammad, a compassionate doctor, confronts the challenges of healthcare amidst dwindling supplies and occupation brutality, showcasing remarkable dedication to healing.     Tamer: A Dream Deferred As for myself, Tamer, I was on the verge of a new beginning, with aspirations to further my career in Germany. I had saved thousands of dollars for the mandatory block account to support my stay abroad. However, the conflict has not only shattered my professional dreams but also consumed what didn\u2019t burn of my savings, compelling me to fight for my family\u2019s survival amidst the escalating costs of basic human necessities. Donate to Standing with a Family Escaping the Horrors of War in Gaza., organised by Abdallah Ghunaim   [Picture of the family before the war]         I have lost the lives of my dearest friends, neighbors, and much of what I loved. We have lost our home with all its dreams and memories. A five-floor house completely leveled to the ground!!

[picture of the destroyed neighborhood]       Donate to Standing with a Family Escaping the Horrors of War in Gaza., organised by Abdallah Ghunaim   Since the beginning of the war, we were forced to flee our home in the north of the Gaza Strip to the supposed safe area in the south. But unfortunately, this was just the beginning. We have been displaced four times in the same southern area, fleeing from death always surrounding us.   Initially, we fled to a school belonging to the UNRWA in the Nuseirat camp until we were forced to move to another area, and the Maghazi camp was the intended destination. Then a UNRWA school, where we were residing in a tent inside, was targeted, killing 7 civilians. We were forced to flee again to a tent in Rafah, but the scarcity of clean water and the spread of epidemics and diseases forced us to flee again to a UNRWA school in the Deir Al-Balah area until now.   UNRWA has been providing refuge to hundreds of displaced families for the past six months at schools that have become vital community hubs, offering shelter to thousands of individuals trapped in the southern region. Women and children sleep inside classrooms, and the men sleep outside in tents set up in the courtyard. Rainstorms recently have flooded our tents, and it\u2019s very difficult to take care of our basic needs.   [Pictures of Tamer after the war in the UNRWA school and his tent]             I am currently volunteering at Al-Aqsa Hospital, assisting in the maxillofacial surgery department. However, a sense of helplessness and despair often overwhelms me. It\u2019s hard to put into words the horrors and injuries I witness daily. Surrounded by the shroud of death and the cries of the wounded, I feel powerless. \u201cI want to save you, I want you to live,\u201d I often think, \u201cI will do everything in my power to make it happen!\u201d Sadly, many times, they become part of the countless casualties from my homeland.

Donate to Standing with a Family Escaping the Horrors of War in Gaza., organised by Abdallah Ghunaim   Now we hope to escape death, we hope for the end of the war, we hope to leave the Gaza Strip, and we hope to live a decent life away from bombing, occupation, and destruction.   It has been 9 months of hell and horror. This genocide has been too long to bear, and our mental health and lives are in constant danger. (I can\u2019t describe enough what I have been dealing with daily in the hospitals for the past days. We have reached a point where there is no hope left for us here in Gaza, where we are unfortunately just waiting for our turn to die, and even if there is a ceasefire, the destruction in Gaza is beyond prompt repair   Evacuation fees are expensive, especially now that I have no source of income. Once we can evacuate, your donations will cover our travel expenses and help us get immediate support in Egypt. There will be meal expenses, wardrobe expenses, emergency expenses, etc., but no generous contribution will go to waste.   To cross the \u201cRafah\u201d Gaza-Egypt Borders, you need to have your name listed in the Crossing List (paid permit), and coordinators in Egypt who have the power to add my family\u2019s names to the list at the border are now asking for anywhere from $6-8,000 per PERSON! They will not add the names until we can prove we have the money ready.   I ask for your help because this is not just my battle alone, but a battle in which we seek your helping hand to survive and preserve our families. Any donation, big or small, will have a huge impact on the lives of my family and me. I am grateful to everyone who donates, and I will remain grateful forever for giving hope and opportunity to me and my family to survive and build a better future.   Thank you for reading my story.

I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s his canon (he likes karlach. she was there. his gauge of what is an acceptable sacrifice is rusted to hell but having a friend go YOU BOTH KNOW THIS SHIT\u2019S FUCKED helps him go 'god we really do don\u2019t we\u2019) but it is interesting to think thru as a disaster that could\u2019ve happened. especially given the fact he\u2019s incredibly close with lae'zel and ends up letting her go in the end so like. local guy saves the world, realizes he needs therapy, and ends where he started: alone in baldur\u2019s gate.  thank god you changed your mind and nailed some persuasion rolls in the eleventh hour my dude because you Needed that near miss for your character growth and also probably your eventual mental health",

        "summary": "i-cant-sing: Okay but I need yall to help me figure out the character(s) for the following scenario: Imagine a romantic yandere falling for reader, and ofc reader isn\u2019t in love with yandere for obvious reasons like red flags. Maybe they did try dating, Yandere is a charmer, comes from a rich family, he\u2019s smart and hardworking and oh so head over heels in love with you. He\u2019s always taking you out on best dates, HAS to get you the largest fucking bouquets (excellent taste in flowers) and buys you expensive but well thought out gifts.  But for whatever reason, things dont work out and you break things off hastily and most likely over the phone before leaving the country. And yandere just- breaksdown. I mean my man does not have a good mental health as is, but you leaving, actually leaving him just breaks him down and he has a full blown panic attack. I\u2019m talking about yandere falling to his knees, clutching his chest and  gasping for air, tears streaming down his face as he screams your name like a mad man. His family, they love him, they adore their son/brother/grandchild sm, it pains them to see him in such a miserable state. Yandere man is so delirious that he has to be sedated, tranquillised by medical professionals because he\u2019s just losing his fucking mind, babbling your name over and over again like a mad man. His condition only worsens as time passes, and so his family decides to take drastic measures because they can\u2019t see their beloved son/brother/grandkid so fucking dead and depressed and a shell of a once bright man. They love him so much, they only want ti see him happy, so they use their money and influence to track you down and try to convince you to return and take yandere back. When you refuse, they take the high way and force you to come with them, dragging you kicking and screaming to their private jet and fly all the way home, where yandere is. You\u2019re in a dishevelled state, tears running down your cheeks as you struggle to free yourself from their grasps as they take you to yandere. And when yandere sees you\u2026 for the first time in months, his family sees the light return in his eyes as the yandere reaches out for you, scared that you\u2019re just his mind playing tricks. When he finally touches you, he is immeadiately pulling you into a hug, arms tightening around your body like a gilded cage as he cries into your shoulder and thanks his family for bringing you back. His family only smiles with tears in their eyes as they lock the door behind them when they leave, so that you don\u2019t go running away. Meanwhile, yandere has pulled you into his lap and he\u2019s looking at you with such sad eyes, staring at each feature of yours over and over again as if to memorise it all again. He can\u2019t help the tears that continue to slip out of his eyes, maybe he\u2019s crying that you\u2019re finally here, or maybe he\u2019s crying for all the time that\u2019s been lost when you weren\u2019t here. You fall asleep soon due to exhaustion, but yandere doesn\u2019t sleep a wink that night because he continues to stare at you and play with your hair very gently, finally closing his eyes when morning comes and he wraps his arms around you and traps your legs with his. By now, you guys realise that the yandere\u2019s family is not only yandere for their son/brother/grandson but also for you. They are yandede for you too, but they\u2019re not allowing you to leave them or their son or even make him unhappy ever again. Some members are willing to let all you \u201ctantrums\u201d slide, while others are not so kind. BUT one thing is for sure, you\u2019re ALWAYS safe with yandere s/o, no matter what. Now, for the characters I\u2019ve had in kind for this scenario are: Halim Mehmet Shah and the Shah Family (my ocs)Dabi/Shotou and Todoroki clan (I am the OG creator of Yandere Todoroki Clan)I wanna say Naoya or Toji but the Zenin clan hates them both\u2026.Dick Grayson/Jason Todd and BatfamWhat do you guys think?   Mood board for this scenario^^^(I love Pinterest) \nCould also see this happening with Baldwin <3",

        "summary": "Since the 2020 murder of George Floyd, the Minneapolis Police Department has struggled to retain and recruit staff. Now, city leaders are trying to improve other avenues to support the police department.\u00a0 \nThe Minneapolis City Council Public Health and Safety Committee met on July 24 to discuss the Center for Justice Research and Innovation recommendations to the MPD, especially concerning staffing and non-police response implementations.\u00a0 \nThe committee\u2019s recommendations cover multiple aspects of MPD including staffing and police operations. The staffing recommendations include implementing non-police response operations and reconsidering officer time spent responding to calls. \nAs of July 2024, the MPD has 568 staff officers but is budgeted for 713 staff officers, according to data provided by MPD Spokesperson Garrett Parten.\u00a0 \nMPD recruits at college career fairs in and out of Minnesota, Community Service Officer program events, local high schools and diversity-focused events, according to Parten. Recently, the department has used social media advertising and QR codes on police cars to increase recruitment exposure.\u00a0 \nCouncil Member Robin Wonsley (Ward 2) said in a statement that her office is dedicated to identifying what changes were successfully made to the MPD, especially in areas of misconduct, discipline and coaching. Wonsley authored a legislative directive earlier this year asking for updates about recommendations from the committee\u2019s study to the MPD.\u00a0 \nDuring the committee\u2019s meeting in July, Wonsley spearheaded questions regarding MPD\u2019s work with the Behavioral Crisis Response (BCR) team in the face of a short-staffed department.\u00a0 \nPolice Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said the Department needs the BCR\u2019s support, but they need more resources so officers are not responding to mental health crisis calls.\u00a0 \n\u201cIt\u2019s very much needed. It\u2019s very helpful,\u201d O\u2019Hara said in the meeting. \u201cI do know there are still times when there is not a BCR unit available and police duty answer calls because they\u2019re busy with other calls and that type of thing.\u201d \nDirector of 911 Joni Hodne said the BCR is spread thin and needs more people to respond to calls. Hodne added the BCR and police sometimes respond to calls together in instances where the situation is expected to be violent or involve weapons.",

        "summary": "Weight-loss drugs have attracted investor interest and shaken up other sectors over the past year. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly were two early winners of this trend, as their drugs dominate the weight-loss drug market. Yuri Khodjamirian, fund manager of the TEMA ETF, said the two companies are a \u201cvery powerful duopoly.\u201d \u201cBut obviously there will be room in such a large market. Currently there are estimates from Goldman Sachs of about $130 billion. We think it will be several times more than that,\u201d he told CNBC Pro Talks last week. Khodjamirian believes there is room for at least three players in the sector. \u201cI think the market is big enough to sustain three to four players, even at the market capitalizations that they have right now, but the market is trying to figure out who the third or fourth player is, and a big breakthrough could be oral GLP-1,\u201d he said. He was referring to GLP-1, a class of weight-loss drugs originally developed as a treatment for diabetes. GLP-1 is a hormone secreted in the intestine that stimulates insulin secretion, slows stomach emptying and communicates a feeling of satiety to the brain. Among stocks to watch, Khodjamirian named Amgen, which is developing an injectable drug for obesity, and other products. He also pointed to a few biotech names that have potential, but investors should be cautious about them. One of them is Carmot, which was acquired by pharmaceutical firm Roche last year, he said. He also named smaller biotech firms such as Zealand Pharma and Viking Therapeutics. \u201cThese companies are early biotechs that are developing data. They are much riskier than larger companies that already have drugs on the market,\u201d Khodjamirian said. \u201cAnd so, you have to be very careful investing in such companies. So a diversified portfolio is probably the best approach,\u201d he said. TEMA ETFs offers actively managed exchange-traded funds focusing on healthcare and life sciences. Khodjamirian is also the chief investment officer of TEMA ETFs and manages its Monopolies & Oligopolies ETF, which seeks to provide investors with long-term growth through companies that operate in monopolistic industry structures. Khodjamirian highlighted three ETFs managed by his firm that are in the healthcare industry: TEMA GLP-1, Obesity & Cardiometabolic ETF; TEMA Oncology ETF; and TEMA Neuroscience & Mental Health ETF. He said there is a \u201cvaluation opportunity\u201d in biotech stocks at the moment, but warned about risks.  \u201cIt's hard to pick small companies in the biotech sector. You really have to know what you're getting into, and \u2026 in most of our biotech portfolio, we have 50 stocks, we don't own more than 1%, 2% in some of these companies because of these risks, they could go to zero,\u201d he said. However, there's \u201ca lot\u201d of innovation happening in biotech, and \u201ca lot of them\u201d are trading below the value of the cash on their balance sheets, Khodjamirian said. \u201cSo there's a valuation opportunity there,\u201d he added. \n\n\n\nThe post Fund manager on names in weight loss, biotech appeared first on Tkpnews.",

My bathroom has reached near gas station levels of embarrassment and I wake up every day thinking I\u2019ll clean it, and then forgetting about it until I need to use it again. Why don\u2019t I clean it when I use it? I ask myself that, especially now. Every night I go to sleep with the hope that tomorrow will be the day I clean the bathroom, mop the house, take a shower, eat healthy, work out, go outside\u2013all the things that people \u2018should\u2019 do because it means you\u2019re trying, living. I don\u2019t wake up in the morning knowing that I won\u2019t do any of those things that day or that if I really try I might complete at least one of those on the list. \n\n\n\nI have the disease of self expression, and while I am your standard stay at home, go no where unless necessary, stay in my room all day kind of introvert, my desire for connectivity (and perhaps also empathy) compel me to write on the internet. Writing is the only thing I have ever been consistent with since I was a kid. My hobby of making jewelry earlier this year came crashing onto me like a tsunami only for it to now be a shallow bubbling brook in my life, the same as with knitting, crochet, sculpting, webpage design, coding, photoshop, resin creations, sewing, and a very brief time as a content creator back in the early days of Instagram, when sliding into DM\u2019s was new and people were more interested in cleavage and pretty photos then actual content creation. Despite my writing being the thing I still do, I have yet to finish a book, but I have started many. Outlines, character descriptions, plot points, pages of dialogue\u2013end up at the dusty shelf we have in our minds, like special cookware we don\u2019t use unless we have company over or for a very specific recipe that requires it, like the double boiler I bought to make flan, which I only make around the holidays.",

Ffs its not lying if its to employers or cops and look up ur rights on what they can and cannot ask u many places ban asking about ur record and transportation status and things like that resources will also tell u how they reword sketchy questions so ur prepared \nHey. Take it from a former HR person\u2026 this goes double right now.  I just spent some time putting in some job applications myself (not for HR, lol) and got about 15 interviews. And idk if it\u2019s because of COVID uncertainty or if places just don\u2019t fucking care anymore because they know people are desperate for work, but the amount of straight up illegal shit\u00a0my interviewers asked me was appalling.  (That\u2019s not even counting the questions that were technically\u00a0legal but clearly fishing for information they\u2019re not legally allowed to ask.) A tame example? Two questions into a phone interview, the guy on the other end of the line asked:\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  I said\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d - giving him a chance to rethink that.  He didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  \u201cSir, you are not allowed to ask me that question.\u201d  \u201cWell, I want to know. I\u2019m asking.\u201d  \u201cAnd you\u2019re legally not allowed to ask me that. I\u2019m not required to tell you my age.\u201d  At that point, I guess he managed to remember an old HR bulletin or something (I hope to god he wasn\u2019t actually HR himself), and he said,\u00a0\u201cWell, I need to know if you\u2019re over the age of 18.\u201d (Which is what he should have asked in the first place\u2026 or not, since that was in the application that he could have read.)  \u201cYes. I\u2019m over the age of 18.\u201d\u00a0  And we moved on. Two questions later, he tried another illegal question. I called him on it again and ended the interview, citing that a workplace with such a clear disregard for the law, especially upon first contact with a potential employee, was not going to be a good fit. (They offered me the job anyway, lol. I didn\u2019t send a thank-you or a response.) At a different interview, the majority of questions were\u00a0\u201cfishing\u201d questions - just looking for that info they\u2019re not actually allowed to ask. (This person was also either not really HR or an HR person who was exceptionally bad at their job.) I could tell they were getting frustrated when I dodged answering the personal stuff, and they actually got extremely\u00a0upset when I mentioned later in the interview (re: less relevant work experience) I had worked in HR. They were super flustered for the remainder of our time, and I watched them skip over questions on their sheet they had clearly planned on asking. They KNEW they were being sketchy and were counting on me not knowing anything about HR - or my rights - and so they got upset when I did.  These were super tame\u00a0examples. I\u2019m begging you, if you\u2019re job searching right now, PLEASE\u00a0know your rights. Please know what interviewers are allowed to ask.  Please don\u2019t volunteer information or elaborate more than you\u2019re required to about personal things. Save your words (and everyone\u2019s time) by elaborating why you\u2019re good for the position/what you can do.  I may create a resource list on this shit later but PLEASE PLEASE KNOW THIS STUFF BEFORE YOU TALK TO AN EMPLOYER. This goes for anywhere you\u2019re interviewing as well as your current employer. This also goes for HR. HR may be the person you go to when shitty stuff happens, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re your friend (or competent).  They don\u2019t need to know your age (beyond 16+, 18+, or 21+, depending on the job). They don\u2019t need to know your medical history. (For the love of god, do NOT answer the\u00a0\u201chave you been diagnosed with depression?\u201d question.) They don\u2019t need to know if you have kids or whatever. They don\u2019t need to know a LOT of those things that may appear on an application, including your veteran status, whether you\u2019re on/have been on unemployment, etc. They\u2019re not entitled to know specifics about your transportation (unless you\u2019re using that transportation for the job, like Uber/delivery drivers). Look this up for your state/the job\u2019s state.  Beware questions like\u00a0\u201cWhat year did you graduate?\u201d if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t put dates on your resume (I just put amount of time spent at employers, not dates of employment). They\u2019re fishing for your age. It\u2019s \u201cOh, you know, 100 years ago,\u201d if you feel comfortable making a joke, or\u00a0\u201cAbout [generic number, like 5 or 10] years ago\u201d if not.  Also beware things like the\u00a0\u201cWhat do you do in your free time?\u201d question, even if you already work there. This is not a friendly getting-to-know-you question. This is a basis for judgement. Not up to an invisible standard? They\u2019re going to be biased against you for pay raises, promotions, etc. Mention kids/lots of family/social engagements? That\u2019s a tick against you for not being the kind of person who lives to work (yes, it\u2019s gross and stupid). Mention lots of solitary things? Cool, that\u2019s their mental note to ask more from you because you\u2019re\u00a0\u201cnot doing anything anyway.\u201d By all means, be friendly with your coworkers/talk about shared interests if you want, but it is none\u00a0of your boss\u2019s business, and be aware what could get back to them.\u00a0  Don\u2019t. Tell. Employers. Shit.   \nWe wrote up a handy list of those illegal questions here: 10 Questions You Should Never Be Asked in a Job Interview\u00a0 \n\n\nHopefully people already know this by now, but I saw way too often back when I worked in retail. Don\u2019t add your coworkers or boss on social media. Yes, your coworkers too. You don\u2019t want to accidentally say something to them or have them see a post and mention it to your boss.

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

In a zoomed-in panel of their heads and shoulders in the hug, the woman says \u201cI promise.\u201d They now both have pink flowers tucked behind their ears.

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

Take it from a former HR person\u2026 this goes double right now.  I just spent some time putting in some job applications myself (not for HR, lol) and got about 15 interviews. And idk if it\u2019s because of COVID uncertainty or if places just don\u2019t fucking care anymore because they know people are desperate for work, but the amount of straight up illegal shit\u00a0my interviewers asked me was appalling.  (That\u2019s not even counting the questions that were technically\u00a0legal but clearly fishing for information they\u2019re not legally allowed to ask.) A tame example? Two questions into a phone interview, the guy on the other end of the line asked:\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  I said\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d - giving him a chance to rethink that.  He didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  \u201cSir, you are not allowed to ask me that question.\u201d  \u201cWell, I want to know. I\u2019m asking.\u201d  \u201cAnd you\u2019re legally not allowed to ask me that. I\u2019m not required to tell you my age.\u201d  At that point, I guess he managed to remember an old HR bulletin or something (I hope to god he wasn\u2019t actually HR himself), and he said,\u00a0\u201cWell, I need to know if you\u2019re over the age of 18.\u201d (Which is what he should have asked in the first place\u2026 or not, since that was in the application that he could have read.)  \u201cYes. I\u2019m over the age of 18.\u201d\u00a0  And we moved on. Two questions later, he tried another illegal question. I called him on it again and ended the interview, citing that a workplace with such a clear disregard for the law, especially upon first contact with a potential employee, was not going to be a good fit. (They offered me the job anyway, lol. I didn\u2019t send a thank-you or a response.) At a different interview, the majority of questions were\u00a0\u201cfishing\u201d questions - just looking for that info they\u2019re not actually allowed to ask. (This person was also either not really HR or an HR person who was exceptionally bad at their job.) I could tell they were getting frustrated when I dodged answering the personal stuff, and they actually got extremely\u00a0upset when I mentioned later in the interview (re: less relevant work experience) I had worked in HR. They were super flustered for the remainder of our time, and I watched them skip over questions on their sheet they had clearly planned on asking. They KNEW they were being sketchy and were counting on me not knowing anything about HR - or my rights - and so they got upset when I did.  These were super tame\u00a0examples. I\u2019m begging you, if you\u2019re job searching right now, PLEASE\u00a0know your rights. Please know what interviewers are allowed to ask.  Please don\u2019t volunteer information or elaborate more than you\u2019re required to about personal things. Save your words (and everyone\u2019s time) by elaborating why you\u2019re good for the position/what you can do.  I may create a resource list on this shit later but PLEASE PLEASE KNOW THIS STUFF BEFORE YOU TALK TO AN EMPLOYER. This goes for anywhere you\u2019re interviewing as well as your current employer. This also goes for HR. HR may be the person you go to when shitty stuff happens, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re your friend (or competent).  They don\u2019t need to know your age (beyond 16+, 18+, or 21+, depending on the job). They don\u2019t need to know your medical history. (For the love of god, do NOT answer the\u00a0\u201chave you been diagnosed with depression?\u201d question.) They don\u2019t need to know if you have kids or whatever. They don\u2019t need to know a LOT of those things that may appear on an application, including your veteran status, whether you\u2019re on/have been on unemployment, etc. They\u2019re not entitled to know specifics about your transportation (unless you\u2019re using that transportation for the job, like Uber/delivery drivers). Look this up for your state/the job\u2019s state.  Beware questions like\u00a0\u201cWhat year did you graduate?\u201d if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t put dates on your resume (I just put amount of time spent at employers, not dates of employment). They\u2019re fishing for your age. It\u2019s \u201cOh, you know, 100 years ago,\u201d if you feel comfortable making a joke, or\u00a0\u201cAbout [generic number, like 5 or 10] years ago\u201d if not.  Also beware things like the\u00a0\u201cWhat do you do in your free time?\u201d question, even if you already work there. This is not a friendly getting-to-know-you question. This is a basis for judgement. Not up to an invisible standard? They\u2019re going to be biased against you for pay raises, promotions, etc. Mention kids/lots of family/social engagements? That\u2019s a tick against you for not being the kind of person who lives to work (yes, it\u2019s gross and stupid). Mention lots of solitary things? Cool, that\u2019s their mental note to ask more from you because you\u2019re\u00a0\u201cnot doing anything anyway.\u201d By all means, be friendly with your coworkers/talk about shared interests if you want, but it is none\u00a0of your boss\u2019s business, and be aware what could get back to them.\u00a0  Don\u2019t. Tell. Employers. Shit.   \nWe wrote up a handy list of those illegal questions here: 10 Questions You Should Never Be Asked in a Job Interview\u00a0 \n\n\nHopefully people already know this by now, but I saw way too often back when I worked in retail. Don\u2019t add your coworkers or boss on social media. Yes, your coworkers too. You don\u2019t want to accidentally say something to them or have them see a post and mention it to your boss.

Problem is, he has mental health & drug issues and couldn\u2019t afford to get them all spayed & neutered, so now there are 6 grown bitches with 15 puppies total, and they\u2019ve dug under his fence in multiple places but he can\u2019t afford to fix it so they go roaming all around town. (When I say can\u2019t afford it, I mean his house is currently running on a generator because he can\u2019t afford his electric bill.) He\u2019s also a day laborer so he cannot take multiple full days off work to take them to the vet an hour away. He\u2019s in a really rough spot.  He\u2019s not a bad person. He\u2019s just overwhelmed. And this little conservative town with 6 churches for 300 people, have they tried to help their neighbor? Have they adopted the puppies he\u2019s been trying to give away? Have they offered resources?  NOPE! All they wanna do is talk shit about him and complain about the dogs but never lift a finger of their own. And they come to his house to yell at him and cuss him out about the dogs, which does not exactly engender in him a cooperative attitude, as you might imagine. So after a while of this going on, my mom gets fed up with all the NIMBY bullshit and starts talking to the guy, because she\u2019s done animal rescue for 20-odd years and has Connections. He\u2019s resistant at first, but when he realizes she\u2019s not being an asshole to him on account of his addiction or the dogs, he decides to let her help.  She gets to work organizing and networking. Finds a non-profit that will cover vaccinations, spay/neuter, and flea treatments for all the dogs. Talks the next-door neighbor into paying for materials to fix the fence, since this guy can do the work of it himself. Gets him in touch with another non-profit that will adopt out the adult dogs. Less than 2 weeks after she decided to do something, all puppies have been to the vet, 10 puppies and 4 adult dogs have been adopted out, and the second non-profit is coming by next week to pick up the remaining 7 dogs to ship them out for adoption. I\u2019ve learned a lot of things from my mom\u2014some good, some bad\u2014but I think the most important positive message she lives as an example of is this: sometimes, when something needs done and no one else is willing, you gotta stand up and say \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d",

        "url": "https://www.inilampung.com/2024/07/hijrah-berkali-kali-ala-denny-ja.html",
        "summary": "Oleh Mila Muzakkar  Bernegosiasi dengan takdir. \u201cTrial and Error,\u201d mencoba lalu gagal, mencoba lagi. Mengubah jalan agar tetap sampai ke puncak. Itulah kesan yang saya rasakan setelah lama mendalami pemikiran dan riwayat hidup Denny JA. Dalam bahasanya sendiri, Denny menyatakan, ia melakukan hijrah berkali-kali. Hasilnya memang membuat banyak orang terpana. Denny membuat prestasi untuk banyak hal sekaligus.\u00a0 Ia lima kali memenangkan pilpres berturut-turut, di bidang politik. Di bidang sastra, genre puisi esai yang diciptakannya kini dijadikan festival tingkat ASEAN, yang dibiayai pemerintah Sabah, Malaysia. Di bidang spiritualitas, ia bersama Forum Esoterika membuat tradisi baru merayakan hari besar berbagai agama dan kepercayaan secara lintas iman.\u00a0 Di bidang bisnis dan usaha, Denny juga tumbuh merangkak dari bawah hingga memiliki aset dengan nilai melampaui satu triliun rupiah. Kini ia membawa tradisi baru pula melukis dengan Artificial Intelligence (AI). Sebuah hotel di Jalan Mahakam, Jakarta, menjadi galeri abadi lukisannya.\u00a0 Sebagai penulis, ia sudah membuat lebih dari 100 judul buku bidang politik, filsafat hidup, psikologi, sastra, review film, sejarah, agama, hingga catatan perjalanan. Denny juga mendapatkan penghargaan dari TIME Magazine, memecahkan rekor dunia Guinness Book of World Record, penghargaan sastra tingkat ASEAN dari Malaysia, hingga dicalonkan Nobel Sastra, sastrawan kedua Indonesia setelah Pramudya Ananta Toer. Satu pribadi tapi multi talenta. Denny JA pun menjadi filantropis, banyak membiayai kegiatan budaya, sastra, toleransi agama dan gerakan anti-diskriminasi, membantu banyak penerbitan.\u00a0 Saya ingin memahami energi yang menggerakkan Denny JA. Kaum Milenial dan Generasi Z dapat mengambil inspirasi dari pemikirannya. Buku ini dibuat untuk maksud itu. **Darurat Gangguan Kesehatan Mental** Tahun 2022, Generasi Literat melakukan survei kepada 249 Generasi Z di 28 provinsi, tentang apa keresahan dan masalah terbesar yang mereka hadapi. Hasilnya, isu gangguan kesehatan mental menjadi keresahan nomor dua. Penelitian yang dilakukan oleh Universitas Gajah Mada (UGM), 2021-2022, menyebutkan 2,45 juta anak muda di Indonesia mengalami gangguan kesehatan mental, seperti gangguan kecemasan, depresi mayor, gangguan perilaku 0,9 persen, serta PTSD dan ADHD. Survei lain, dilakukan oleh Indonesia National Adolescent Mental Health Survey tahun 2022, menyebutkan 1,4 persen remaja mengaku memiliki ide bunuh diri, 0,5 persen telah membuat rencana untuk bunuh diri, dan 0,2 persen telah melakukan percobaan bunuh diri.\u00a0 Bukan hanya pada tataran ide dan rencana, selama tahun 2020, sebanyak 2.700 anak muda sudah melakukan bunuh diri (Asosiasi Bunuh Diri Indonesia).\u00a0 Sementara, menurut Pusat Informasi Kriminal Nasional (Pusiknas) Kepolisian RI, ada 287 kasus bunuh diri sepanjang 1 Januari-15 Maret 2024. Data di atas bukan sekedar angka. Tapi fakta betapa daruratnya kondisi gangguan kesehatan mental generasi muda di negara kita. Mereka mudah menyerah pada tumpukan masalah hidup, hingga memilih mengakhiri hidupnya. Itulah yang dihadapi MPD, mahasiswa FISIP Universitas Indonesia. Tanggal 11 Maret 2023, ia akan diwisuda sebagai sarjana.\u00a0 Namun, tiga hari sebelumnya, ia memilih mengakhiri hidupnya dengan meloncat dari lantai 18 sebuah apartemen di Jakarta Selatan. Di Surabaya, CA, mahasiswi Fakultas Kedokteran Hewan, mati karena menghirup zat beracun di dalam mobilnya.\u00a0 Kejadiannya di bulan November 2023. NJW, mahasiswa Universitas Negeri Semarang, meninggal setelah melompat dari lantai 4 mal Paragon, Semarang.\u00a0 Di Nusa Tenggara Timur, selama Oktober 2023, ada tiga mahasiswa yang tak lama lagi akan diwisuda dari perguruan tinggi berbeda, juga bunuh diri. Tak hanya di Indonesia, di tingkat dunia, berdasarkan data WHO (2019) menunjukkan saat ini lebih banyak orang mati bukan karena perang atau kelaparan, tapi karena bunuh diri (793 ribu). Ada apa dengan generasi muda kita? Mengapa mereka sampai pada titik menyerah pada hidup? Tak adakah cara untuk melewati masalah itu, atau makna hidup tertinggi yang mereka ingin capai itu yang tak ada? **Memaknai Hidup** \u201cKe mana hidup ini harus diarahkan? Apa makna tertinggi dari hidup ini?\u201d, akan dikenang sebagai apakah jika saya mati nanti?\u201d Pertanyaan-pertanyaan itu yang selalu mengganggu di keheningan malamnya. Ia selalu merenung, merefleksikan, menggali, hingga \u201chijrah\u201d berkali-kali untuk \u201cmenjadi manusia\u201d. Dialah Denny JA\u2014seorang intelektual, penulis, penyair, sastrawan, video maker, konsultan politik, pengusaha, dan filantropis. Ia adalah pembelajar ulung dan multitalenta.\u00a0 Hasil-hasil renungan hidup yang ia tuangkan dalam berbagai karyanya: buku, puisi, video, dan lukisan, telah memberikan banyak pencerahan tentang bagaimana sebaiknya kita memaknai hidup dengan terus \u201cmenjadi manusia\u201d. Dalam pandangan saya, \u201cmenjadi manusia\u201d artinya menjadi orang yang berprinsip untuk menjalani hidup dengan berpikir dan bertindak dalam kebaikan dan kebenaran, seperti tujuan Tuhan menciptakan manusia.\u00a0 Ketika dalam proses itu, manusia \u201ckeseleo\u201d, \u201ckeserempet\u201d, atau \u201ckecebur\u201d ke lubang yang bernama \u201ckesalahan\u201d, maka ia akan berusaha kembali kepada prinsip \u201cmenjadi manusia\u201d. Begitu seterusnya, sampai kembali pada Sang Pencipta. \u201cHijrah\u201d berkali-kali adalah proses Denny menjadi manusia. Ia terus berusaha mencari passion-nya, memperkaya dirinya dengan melahap berbagai genre ilmu pengetahuan dan keterampilan hidup, bahkan bernegosiasi dengan takdirnya ketika ia merasa gagal, lalu mencari jalan yang lebih sejati. Pada akhirnya,\u00a0 Denny sampai pada puncak pencariannya, yaitu jalan menuju kebajikan. **Buku Menjadi Manusia: Menggali Makna Hidup dari Denny JA** Perjalanan Denny memaknai hidup sebagai manusia menurut saya menjadi penting dan relevan untuk dijadikan pelajaran, khususnya untuk generasi muda (Milenial dan Gen-Z), yang saat ini berada pada titik darurat gangguan kesehatan mental. Kenapa Denny JA? Karena ia adalah pembelajar ulung. Denny melahap berbagai genre ilmu pengetahuan: filsafat, agama, sastra, politik, ekonomi, bisnis, gender, lingkungan, pengembangan diri, sampai isu-isu kekinian yang dibicarakan Milenial dan Gen-Z seperti mental health, AI, dan media sosial. Saya berpikir, Denny ini seperti paket lengkap: berwawasan sangat luas, pola pikirnya sangat maju, update terhadap isu-isu kekinian, bijak dalam menghadapi berbagai situasi, dan yang paling penting ia menggunakan kekayaannya di jalan yang benar: untuk menolong orang yang membutuhkan. Buku ini tentu saja tak bermaksud mengatakan: Denny JA adalah manusia yang sempurna. Absolutely No! Karena rumput yang bergoyang pun tahu, semua manusia pasti punya kelemahan dan kelebihan.\u00a0 Tapi, saya pun percaya, setiap manusia bisa menjadi tempat dan guru untuk mengambil pelajaran hidup. Itulah yang membuat saya menuliskan buku yang berjudul \u201cMenjadi Manusia: Menggali Makna Hidup dari Denny JA\u201d. Buku mungil yang berisi kumpulan tulisan pendek, ringan, serta dikemas dengan bahasa yang sangat populer ini, berusaha menggali pengetahuan dan kebijaksanaan hidup dari sosok Denny JA, yang sudah ia sebar di berbagai media sosial dan di lukisannya yang menggunakan Artificial Intelligence (AI). Karya-karya itu sebagian saya kutip langsung, apa adanya, lalu saya elaborasi dan relevansikan dengan isu-isu kekinian yang dihadapi Milenial dan Gen-Z.\u00a0 Dalam beberapa bagian, saya berikan masukan yang diperlukan, serta memperkayanya dengan menambahkan pengalaman pribadi yang relevan. Buku ini terbagi menjadi tiga bagian utama. Bagian pertama berisi tentang bagaimana menjadi pribadi yang bertumbuh. Beberapa cara yang dapat dilakukan seperti, bernegosiasi dengan takdir, mencari makna hidup, melampaui diri, karakter autentik, rumus sehat di dunia digital, hidup optimis & kekuatan psikologis.\u00a0 Dengan mempraktikkan cara-cara di atas, harapannya, Milenial dan Gen-Z akan memiliki mindset yang lebih jernih, sehat, dan positif, dalam memandang dan merespons berbagai permasalahan hidup. Bagian kedua akan mengeksplor lebih dalam tentang apa sebenarnya makna cinta. Cinta di sini dibicarakan dalam konteks yang luas, seperti bentuk cinta yang tertinggi, agama cinta, cinta dalam spiritualitas, cinta yang dibutuhkan orang tua, cinta lingkungan, cinta pada pekerjaan, cinta beda agama, serta tipe pemimpin yang dicintai rakyatnya.\u00a0 Dengan landasan cinta, harapannya apa pun yang kita lakukan, akan berdasarkan semangat cinta kasih kepada sang Pencipta dan ciptaannya, alam semesta. Bagian ketiga buku ini menonjolkan manusia \u201cbertelinga besar\u201d sebagai ikon manusia yang lebih peka, peduli dan empati kepada orang-orang di pinggirkan, yang suaranya jarang didengarkan.\u00a0 Suara-suara itu ada pada penderitaan anak-anak di Gaza, pernikahan anak di berbagai belahan dunia, pemerkosaan pada anak-anak di lembaga pendidikan agama, pelarangan ibadah kelompok penganut agama/kepercayaan, perihnya menjadi seorang LGBT, pengekangan tubuh perempuan, hingga merebaknya kebohongan dan fitnah di dunia digital. Maka, sekali lagi, buku ini begitu penting dibaca oleh Milenial dan Gen-Z khususnya, sebagai inspirasi dan mungkin panduan, dalam mencari makna hidup yang sejati.\u00a0 Sehingga mereka tak lagi menjadi generasi yang rapuh, pesimis, dan mudah menyerah pada masalah kehidupan. Sebaliknya, mereka akan terus berproses \u201cmenjadi manusia\u201d untuk dirinya, juga untuk manusia lainnya.*** *) Penulis adalah Founder Generasi Literat, Trainer Pengembangan Diri, dan Pegiat Anak Muda",

        "summary": "Fat loss is a primary goal for many individuals engaged in physical fitness. However, the optimal approach to achieve this goal remains a topic of debate. Two popular methods are sprinting and low-impact running. This article will delve into the science behind both activities, comparing their effectiveness for fat loss, and providing actionable insights for incorporating them into your fitness regimen. \n\n\n\nBefore comparing sprinting and low-impact running, it\u2019s important to understand how fat loss occurs. Fat loss happens when the body uses more energy (calories) than it consumes. This energy deficit forces the body to break down stored fat into fatty acids, which are then utilised for energy. \n\n\n\nTable of ContentsSprinting: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)The Mechanism of HIITShort, Intense BurstsEnhanced Caloric BurnBenefits of Sprinting for Fat LossExcess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC)Muscle Preservation and GrowthHormonal BenefitsPractical ConsiderationsTime EfficiencyVersatilityPotential RisksLow-Impact Running: Steady-State CardioThe Mechanism of Steady-State CardioContinuous, Moderate IntensitySustained Caloric BurnBenefits of Low-Impact Running for Fat LossOptimal Fat OxidationCardiovascular HealthSustainability and Low Risk of InjuryPractical ConsiderationsAccessibilityMental Health BenefitsTime CommitmentComparative Analysis: Sprinting vs.",

Still, I took a couple of screening tests and got back confirmation that I don\u2019t fit the ADHD profile. Which I knew, but for some reason every platform I\u2019m on thinks I do.  I was the kid who\u2019s mother said, \u201cSit here\u201d, and I would, until she came back in the room hours later wondering what I was doing there. I took a skills assessment in high school that suggested I would be good at factory piecework. Give me a task, and I\u2019ll do it until it is done. Probably should have pursued data entry.  I am ruthlessly punctual. I pay bills early. I may be suffering a host of other mental maladies but ADHD is so unlike me, it made me curious about what is provoking the ads. The best I can guess is my tendency to blast through spotify suggested music that I don\u2019t like. If they gave me better suggestions, I might listen to the full song.  Anyway, I mention all this not because I have strong feelings about ADHD, but because the way these ads are presented, they make you question yourself-in the same manner as diet/wellness crap does. Imagine sending  that to someone feeling vulnerable about their mental health. You know what would help people with ADHD? Access to medication (how long have the meds been in short supply), universal healthcare, and less stigmatization. Know what probably isn\u2019t helpful? Whatever the hell they\u2019re trying to sell you in the ad.  I should point out that when I was 95 lbs I was getting ads for ozempic, so who knows where they get the data from.  Anyone else getting a slew of ads for a specific mental illness?",

UTIs can cause psychosis. taking drugs, even safe drugs, or prescription drugs, can cause psychosis. i was once prescribed a heavy regimen of vitamin D because i was deficient, but the doctor never told me to stop taking it, so i moved to california, stopped being deficient, and developed vitamin d toxicity with downstream hyperparathyroidism which triggered significant hypomania that was undetected and uncontrolled for yeeeeeeears. i just slowly got Weird and started making impulsive decisions based on slightly out-of-gamut beliefs. i drove cross country by myself to have a love affair. the love affair was real, the series of decisions leading to burning down my life in pursuit of it were based on not great brain function however. etc. you see what i mean. churchill mentioned depression being the \u201cblack dog who stalks us\u201d (one reason for Churchgrim\u2019s multi-referential name) but theres another, stealthier dog called Insanity and it\u2019s closer to some people than others but man it sneaks up on you. every time i see one of those \u201cguy gets weird and drives into the wilderness forever\u201d missing persons stories i think \u201cyeah i could totally pull that off\u201d \u201cvan gogh cut off his ear what a lunatic\u201d you are 3 nights of bad sleep, getting unexpected upsetting news and taking a substance as benign as coffee at the wrong time away from doing the same hope this helps",

        "summary": "Photo: Instagram/Logan Paul Logan Paul was shocked to learn how much his brother, Jake Paul, charged fans to watch his recent fight against Mike Perry. Jake won the fight with a knockout, marking his tenth professional boxing win.  After the match, Logan and Jake sat down to talk about Jake's performance and his upcoming fight with Mike Tyson on November 15. Logan was surprised to find out that the fight cost $64.99 for U.S. viewers. Logan said, \"Conor McGregor is your biggest fan.   He definitely watched it live then hopped on to X.\" Jake responded, \"Thanks for the 65 bucks [dollars].\" Logan, stunned, replied, \"Dude, your pay-per-views are $65 now? Man, that's crazy. That's so cool, man, wow.\" Photo: Instagram/Logan Paul The conversation shifted to UFC star Conor McGregor, who criticized Jake on social media and fired Perry from his bare-knuckle promotion BKFC. Logan commented, \"That was a common Conor McGregor move to fire him. He's a broken man, but he's still entertaining. Also, his bank account is still, wow.\"  Jake and McGregor have a history of back-and-forth on social media, with Jake trying to lure McGregor back into the boxing ring. However, a fight between them is unlikely since they are in different weight classes, and McGregor is still under contract with the UFC.  At his post-fight press conference, Jake challenged McGregor, saying, \"Conor McGregor can say what he wants, but he won't fight me either. So I knocked out Mike Perry. Conor McGregor, let's run it, but you won't do it because you know what's gonna happen. You know what I did to Nate Diaz, who you went toe-to-toe with. So, Conor McGregor, get in the gym and start winning fights. And then maybe we can have a conversation.\"  Read Next: Paddy Pimblett Almost Withdraws From UFC 304 Due To Mental Health Struggles  Source: Talk Sports\u00a0",

        "summary": "Learn more below about the \u201churkle durkle\u201d trend, why it\u2019s so popular, and why Summer is the perfect season to try it\u00a0out! Credit: Shutterstock/Roman SamborskyiWhile summer can be a time to make memories with friends and family through vacations, road trips, and the like, many consider it a time of rest and relaxation. For those who like to spend their summer doing nothing, the recent internet trend of \u201churkle durkling\u201d is\u00a0perfect. The Scottish term has gained popularity through social media like TikTok for its focus on lounging around and delaying productivity, typically associated with vacation time. While you could hurkle durkle any time of the year, it makes sense to follow this trend during the summertime. When paired with these recommendations, the hurkle durkle is a surefire way to have your best summer\u00a0yet! What does the phrase \u201churkle durkle\u201d\u00a0mean?According to an article from the New York Post, the phrase means \u201cto lie in bed or lounge about when one should be up and about.\u201d The article discusses how it is separate from bed rotting since the latter can occur at any point in the day, while hurkle durkling is reserved for the morning hours. So, essentially, you can follow the trend by hitting snooze on your alarm clock and staying put a little while longer when it\u2019s time to get up and start the\u00a0day. The video below is one of the most popular that talks about the\u00a0trend: https://medium.com/media/f36e204a301bebca014bdb9783b91526/hrefBased on the extensive audience support, it seems like lounging is a readily accepted practice for the most\u00a0part. The article goes on to explain how not only is the phrase fun to say; but there are also health benefits associated with hurkle durkling. Overall, the practice has been linked to better health and quality of life by ensuring the extra bit of rest that comes from lingering in bed in the\u00a0morning. Different perspectives on hurkle\u00a0durklingSupport for the\u00a0trendA recent New York Times article discussed the act of hurkle durkling as a health trend for 2024, along with some other current Gen Z favorites. It appears that taking time for rest and relaxation is becoming more of a priority for 2024. Summer often provides this time, as well as an opportunity to adopt new wellness practices to improve health and well-being. Questions and\u00a0concernsOn the flip side, some are hesitant about consistently indulging in extra relaxation time. A Forbes article published in early July by Dr. Lance Eliot considers the benefits, risks, and other facets of the\u00a0trend. Eliot\u2019s article offers an extensive look at different perspectives on the trend. He mentions that some might look down on delaying productivity based on preconceived notions, but the trend opens the door for more nuanced conversations, specifically about mental\u00a0health. Another unique perspective explored by Eliot is that of is Generative AI, since many people look at their phones while lying in\u00a0bed: An added twist is that in current times we can add generative AI into this equation. Modern-day generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are readily used while lounging around in bed. Does this then change the proposition underlying the considered negative perceptions of doing a hurkle-durkle? Should we reconsider the nature of hurkling-durkling?Dr. Lance\u00a0EliotEliot\u2019s article provides an excellent summary of the trend and connects it to other relevant topics. Based on his article, the trend seems to be more than just an internet phenomenon\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s also important for one\u2019s mental and physical\u00a0health. TikTok\u2019s take on the\u00a0trendAlong with the original video linked above, TikTok has dedicated several videos to the trend. Some videos focus more on the fun angle, while others delve into the various health benefits. The video below used the same sound as the first video, but the user still made the trend unique to\u00a0them: https://medium.com/media/f6af4b7c34ec41b85c001f954c33445a/hrefMeanwhile, this video, posted by NatureMade, a vitamin brand, promoted hurkle durkling for its health benefits: https://medium.com/media/5f4fa8e98c63313e45c1849ecf74815d/hrefAdditionally, this user\u2019s video is an example of someone who was hurkle durkling regularly without even knowing\u00a0it: https://medium.com/media/8a1ea4e9b78747049249c34a97cc02b5/hrefThis user\u2019s video refers to the trend as an \u201cart\u201d and thanked its creators: https://medium.com/media/e3cd8fb3231a462dca9eb5eb3f5b8c6f/hrefAnd lastly, this user\u2019s video showed that the trend is not limited to just humans\u2013pets can join in as\u00a0well! https://medium.com/media/3d8cff6ad963bf1f39df64755365df26/hrefConclusionBased on the consensus from these articles and TikTok videos, hurkle durkling is a fun and effective way to prioritize your\u00a0health. Of course, with any trend, it is important to consider what is best for your lifestyle and needs. Practicing in moderation is always a good idea. Relaxation is necessary, but there needs to be a balance between stepping back from your life and living it\u00a0out. The choice is yours, and you can decide if it fits into your daily life. While you can hurkle durkle in any season, summer is typically the most relaxing time. So for now, enjoy the rest of the summer, and hurkle durkle your way\u00a0through!

She is the founder of rkTherapy, a London based bespoke psychology consultancy, and a specialist in culturally-attuned Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). \n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on mental health on a global scale exacerbating feelings of existential crisis and uncertainty. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology (2021) explored the rise in existential distress during the pandemic. The research revealed that the pandemic intensified experiences of uncertainty and anxiety as individuals faced extreme disruptions to their daily routine, leading to existential questions about purpose and mortality. The study found that these heightened existential concerns were strongly linked to increased levels of anxiety, depression, and overall mental distress. \n  \n\n  \nThe research suggests that spiritual awareness provides a sense of purpose and connectedness, which can act as a buffer against mental health challenges. Moreover, the study emphasises the role of spiritual well-being in enhancing resilience and overall life satisfaction, indicating that spiritual health should be considered a crucial component of comprehensive mental health care.",

        "summary": "defilerwyrm: There\u2019s this guy in town who owns this little house, and a while back he rescued a street dog that was going to get put down. Turned out she was pregnant.  Problem is, he has mental health & drug issues and couldn\u2019t afford to get them all spayed & neutered, so now there are 6 grown bitches with 15 puppies total, and they\u2019ve dug under his fence in multiple places but he can\u2019t afford to fix it so they go roaming all around town. (When I say can\u2019t afford it, I mean his house is currently running on a generator because he can\u2019t afford his electric bill.) He\u2019s also a day laborer so he cannot take multiple full days off work to take them to the vet an hour away. He\u2019s in a really rough spot.  He\u2019s not a bad person. He\u2019s just overwhelmed. And this little conservative town with 6 churches for 300 people, have they tried to help their neighbor? Have they adopted the puppies he\u2019s been trying to give away? Have they offered resources?  NOPE! All they wanna do is talk shit about him and complain about the dogs but never lift a finger of their own. And they come to his house to yell at him and cuss him out about the dogs, which does not exactly engender in him a cooperative attitude, as you might imagine. So after a while of this going on, my mom gets fed up with all the NIMBY bullshit and starts talking to the guy, because she\u2019s done animal rescue for 20-odd years and has Connections. He\u2019s resistant at first, but when he realizes she\u2019s not being an asshole to him on account of his addiction or the dogs, he decides to let her help.  She gets to work organizing and networking. Finds a non-profit that will cover vaccinations, spay/neuter, and flea treatments for all the dogs. Talks the next-door neighbor into paying for materials to fix the fence, since this guy can do the work of it himself. Gets him in touch with another non-profit that will adopt out the adult dogs. Less than 2 weeks after she decided to do something, all puppies have been to the vet, 10 puppies and 4 adult dogs have been adopted out, and the second non-profit is coming by next week to pick up the remaining 7 dogs to ship them out for adoption. I\u2019ve learned a lot of things from my mom\u2014some good, some bad\u2014but I think the most important positive message she lives as an example of is this: sometimes, when something needs done and no one else is willing, you gotta stand up and say \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d",

After a year of the therapy, the department reported to Congress in 2019, 76% of 16,000 participating autistic children saw no change, and 9% worsened.\u201d Okay before we get anyone on here saying \u201cwater is wet\u201d, here are some other bullet points about the article. The article uses proper terminology and actually defines stimming, masking, and many other words that neurotypical people may or may not know (re autism)The data that the article is based off of includes first hand accounts from autistic people who have gone through ABA. The researchers even used ASAN (autism self advocacy) as a resource! Actual autistic people shared their stories!!! And they believed us!!!!!It explains WHY autistic people have a hard time with ABA, which is incredible. Not just the fact that it\u2019s akin to training a dog, but the psychology of it, and how it\u2019s overstimulating and degradingThere\u2019s a part that does quote from Auti$m $peaks spokespeople, BUT it\u2019s because they\u2019re leading into how neurotypical parents see ABA most often as a \u201csaving grace\u201d to get a \u201cnormal child\u201d and then goes on to tell more about how autistic children perceive ABA, both during and after treatmentOne family\u2019s story tells of how a mother noticed her autistic son would actually hide when she went to turn the computer on for ABA therapy (this was during COVID lockdown) and how she realized something was off because of that. She canceled ABA and found an alternative (called Floor Time) where the child actually directs the play, and the therapist/teacher goes along with what the kid wants/does! There\u2019s a really cool bit on why ABA is usually the only thing available to parents, and the answer is Shitty American Healthcare/Insurance Companies!It notes that ABA therapists don\u2019t really have strict training requirements. You can do a quick online course and become an ABA therapist. It does not require a college degree. That should horrify you. There\u2019s another parallel study with its own data coming out in 2025Honestly, this whole article is a gem. Remember, while \u201cwater is wet\u201d studies seem trivial, we need them in order to get our side of the story taken seriously. Research with credible data that backs up what we\u2019ve been saying is important!  TL; DR?  Huge study with lots of input from autistic people tells us ABA sucks!  Thank you for this addition. A better encouragement for this article than I managed!",

Everyone keeps telling you to do it, worst of all your mom keeps telling you to do it, and it\u2019s not a magical cure-all, but it actually works and rotting in your room shitposting does not help in either scenario.  Also like mental health, voting doesn\u2019t solve the whole problem! But if you aren\u2019t doing this bare minimum thing, the other tools you have aren\u2019t going to work as well as they should either. If you get medicine and continue rotting in your room shitposting, you will probably still be miserable. If you get a union at work but don\u2019t vote for politicians who support unions, the union won\u2019t be able to advocate for its members as effectively and work will still be miserable.

You\u2019re never going to get to a point where you are Done and Never Have To Do It Again (alas,) because time will continue to pass and you will continue to eat meals and the trees will continue to drop leaves into your gutters and right wingers will continue to submit bad bills to every session of congress.

        "summary": "An experimental drug originally developed to treat cancer may help clear HIV from infected cells in the brain, according to a new Tulane University study. \n\nFor the first time, researchers at Tulane National Primate Research Center found that a cancer drug significantly reduced levels of SIV, the nonhuman primate equivalent of HIV, in the brain by targeting and depleting certain immune cells that harbor the virus. \nPublished in the journal Brain, this discovery marks a significant step toward eliminating HIV from hard-to-reach reservoirs where the virus evades otherwise effective treatment. \n\u201cThis research is an important step in tackling brain-related issues caused by HIV, which still affect people even when they are on effective HIV medication,\u201d said lead study author Woong-Ki Kim, PhD, associate director for research at Tulane National Primate Research Center. \u201cBy specifically targeting the infected cells in the brain, we may be able to clear the virus from these hidden areas, which has been a major challenge in HIV treatment.\u201d \nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) is an essential component of successful HIV treatment, maintaining the virus at undetectable levels in the blood and transforming HIV from a terminal illness into a manageable condition. However, ART does not completely eradicate HIV, necessitating lifelong treatment. The virus persists in \u201cviral reservoirs\u201d in the brain, liver, and lymph nodes, where it remains out of reach of ART. \nThe brain has been a particularly challenging area for treatment due to the blood-brain barrier \u2014 a protective membrane that shields it from harmful substances but also blocks treatments, allowing the virus to persist. In addition, cells in the brain known as macrophages are extremely long-lived, making them difficult to eradicate once they become infected. \nInfection of macrophages is thought to contribute to neurocognitive dysfunction, experienced by nearly half of those living with HIV. Eradicating the virus from the brain is critical for comprehensive HIV treatment and could significantly improve the quality of life for those with HIV-related neurocognitive problems. \nResearchers focused on macrophages, a type of white blood cell that harbors HIV in the brain. By using a small molecule inhibitor to block a receptor that increases in HIV-infected macrophages, the team successfully reduced the viral load in the brain. This approach essentially cleared the virus from brain tissue, providing a potential new treatment avenue for HIV. \nThe small molecule inhibitor used, BLZ945, has previously been studied for therapeutic use in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and brain cancer, but never before in the context of clearing HIV from the brain.",

Amidst these pressures, one crucial objective remains the same\u2014employee care. This pursuit involves more than just providing competitive salaries and attractive office spaces. It extends to ensuring the overall well-being of employees through comprehensive corporate healthcare benefits. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, corporate healthcare programs can lead to significant cost savings for companies. Healthcare benefits such as preventive care and early intervention reduce the incidence of serious health issues, thereby lowering medical expenses and insurance premiums. Companies can also benefit from reduced turnover rates, as most employees prefer to stay with an employer who prioritizes their well-being.",

Is it a violation of the First Amendment? Is it not? \n\n\n\nThis week, through Dr. P\u2019s Zoom lecture, we learned about the infamous topic of the First Amendment. Ratified in 1791, the First Amendment guarantees several fundamental freedoms that shape the essence of a free society. This reflection aims to delve into what the First Amendment entails, the freedoms it grants, and the complex controversies it engenders. At its core, the First Amendment comprises five freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom to peaceably assemble, and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. These liberties collectively form the bedrock of individual expression and societal engagement, fostering an environment where citizens can voice their opinions, practice their faith, and participate in civic life without fear of censorship or persecution.",

        "title": "Universal Basic Income: The Real Impact of Unconditional Cash",
        "url": "https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/universal-basic-income-real-impact-unconditional-cash/",
        "summary": "Is basic income just a safety net for the lazy, or the key to unlocking true economic freedom? A recent study backed by OpenAIs Sam Altman provided a glimpse into the transformative potential of a universal basic income by giving 1,000 Americans $1,000 per month for three years. Conducted by OpenResearch, this experiment is the largest randomized basic income trial in the US to date, offering valuable insights into how unconditional cash impacts peoples lives. Participants used the extra income to cover essential needs such as housing, food, and transportation. Interestingly, while there was a slight reduction in work hours\u2014particularly among single parents who chose more flexible jobs to spend time with their children\u2014the study dispelled fears of a mass exodus from the workforce.  On average, recipients worked just over an hour less per week compared to the control group. This modest decrease in work hours underscores a crucial point: basic income can provide the flexibility to improve quality of life without eliminating the incentive to work. Health outcomes from the study were nuanced. Although there were no significant improvements in physical health, recipients visited healthcare providers more frequently and spent more on medical care, indicating better access and potentially long-term health benefits. Mental health saw short-lived boosts primarily through reduced stress in the first year, though these effects diminished over time. Despite the mixed results, the study highlighted how financial stability can facilitate better healthcare engagement. One of the standout findings was the enhanced future orientation among recipients. They became better at budgeting, saving, and planning for higher education or entrepreneurial ventures. This shift towards a more proactive and aspirational mindset suggests that basic income can foster not just economic stability but also personal growth and empowerment. The flexibility of cash transfers emerged as a critical theme. Unlike targeted welfare programs, unconditional cash allows recipients to address their unique needs and priorities. This adaptability makes basic income a versatile tool for poverty alleviation, capable of supporting diverse outcomes based on individual circumstances. While the study provided 1,000 recipients with cash, it wasnt just about cash transfers but a broader commentary on the future economic landscape shaped by AI. Altman and other tech leaders like Elon Musk have long warned that AI could lead to widespread job displacement, necessitating a universal basic income (UBI) to maintain societal stability.  This connection, however, is double-edged. Linking UBI too closely with AIs potential job elimination risks undermining the basic income argument if AIs impact on employment doesnt match the dire predictions. The core value of UBI, as the study suggests, lies in its ability to reduce poverty and provide financial stability independent of AIs trajectory. Thus, while AI adds a sense of urgency to the UBI debate, the policys merits stand robustly on their own, advocating for a shift towards unconditional cash transfers to enhance economic security and personal freedom. However, the study also prompts us to reconsider the broader implications of basic income. Should we view it merely as a stopgap measure against poverty or as a foundation for a more equitable and dynamic economy? The debate continues, but one thing is clear: the conversation around basic income must evolve beyond immediate financial impacts to encompass long-term societal and economic transformations.

Everyone keeps telling you to do it, worst of all your mom keeps telling you to do it, and it\u2019s not a magical cure-all, but it actually works and rotting in your room shitposting does not help in either scenario.  Also like mental health, voting doesn\u2019t solve the whole problem! But if you aren\u2019t doing this bare minimum thing, the other tools you have aren\u2019t going to work as well as they should either. If you get medicine and continue rotting in your room shitposting, you will probably still be miserable. If you get a union at work but don\u2019t vote for politicians who support unions, the union won\u2019t be able to advocate for its members as effectively and work will still be miserable. Voting is maintenance. It\u2019s like doing the dishes or cleaning the leaves out of the gutters. You\u2019re never going to get to a point where you are Done and Never Have To Do It Again (alas,) because time will continue to pass and you will continue to eat meals and the trees will continue to drop leaves into your gutters and right wingers will continue to submit bad bills to every session of congress.  You\u2019ll never be done with maintenance. But if you don\u2019t do that maintenance, your situation can and definitely will get Worse Finally a take on the \u2018vote or else\u2019 shit I can vibe with. It\u2019s currently like showering with dysphoria- miserable and annoying with no real positive outcome past the current state not rapidly getting worse, but that\u2019s better than the alternative of things rapidly getting worse",

Dotty...\" That answer obviously wouldn't convince anyone. Fal stopped floating and touched the ground, being quite close to Dotty. He tried to appear confident, but his concern was noticeable   \"Hey... Whatever is upsetling you... Pon... You don't have to talk about it if you don't want, pon. At least company would help, pon?\" What Fal can do? What? Dotty lowers themself and hides their face under their wing.  \"It's not your problem. I got in an argument, that's all.\" Fal murmured an \"ohh\" in response. Hesitantly he looked away and then looked back at Dotty. One of his tassels rested on Dotty's head, trying to give a bit of comfort \"You're right that's not Fal problem, but  that isn't going to stop Fal, pon. If Fal can do anything, just say it. Or even if you don't want nothing, that's ok too. The point is that Fal isn't going to leave, pon\" \"I thought so.\" Dotty sighs. \"Fine, then. Make yourself comfortable.\" At those words, Fal seemed to relax, although his concern was still notable. Fal resumed flight and circled in the air, scattering sparks. Although his movements were playful, his face remained blank. Perhaps what Fal perceived as \"comfortable\" was spinning in the air? If that was the case, it was quite childish, even for an AI Shyly, Fal tried to cheer up Dotty with some topic of interest. Fal would not ask or pressure them \"... Do you... Have any hobbies, pon? Like... Star gazing, drawing, gardening or anything, pon?\" Fal asked while he was floating upside down This is alright? Or Fal is just making things worse? \"I like drawing. I guess. Sometimes I draw in my spare time.\" \"I also like... going outside, when I can.\" Dotty mumbles, their face buried under their wing.  \"Pon... Wait, how can you draw if you don't have hands, pon? Drawing is already a difficult skill to master, and well... That makes it more complicated, pon! \" \u201c\u2026I use my talon\u2026\u201d Dotty looks a bit embarrassed. Fal nodded slowly at the answer. Seeing Dotty's reaction, he thought that perhaps he had been reckless. This was doable, and after somersaulting in the air he landed on the floor. More sparkles and stars flew around, some of them \"sticking\" to Dotty for a few seconds before disappearing. Maybe they just want silence? That would EVIDENTLY be the most logical thing. Fal thought that talking about something in particular would help, but maybe he was just acting without thinking, again Fal stood next to Dotty in complete silence. He wanted to ask several things, he wanted to help them, but again if he forced them to act or talk when it was obvious that they didn't want to, it would only aggravate the situation. For this reason, Fal held the words in his mouth and his tail surrounded Dotty but did not touch them  Dotty stayed silent.  They wanted someone to talk to. They had so much on their mind - too much. Way too much. But they didn't know how to ask, or how to begin. They weren't sure how to ask for help, but it's not like they needed help, right? \"...I got in a fight, if you're curious.\" \"Not... anything physical. It was over the phone.\" Fal turned to look at Dotty, brimming with concern at their words \"What!? You got into a fight, pon!? Tell Fal it wasn't with the people that are hunting you, pon! Or someone else wanted to harm you, pon!?\" \"It wasn't like that. It was an argument with someone at home.\"  \"Those guys are... those guys are no biggie. I can deal with them.\" \"... Pon... Even if those guys aren't the \"biggie\" as you said... More important! You can trust Fal and talk about it... Only if you want, pon... Fal isn't going to pressure, pon. Take your time or... Well, it's obvious that this doesn't have nothing to do with Fal... Fal understand that this is not of Fal's concern... But still! Fal want to support you as much as possible, pon!\" \u201cAnd by \u2018support,\u2019 you mean \u2018not leaving me alone.\u2019\u201d Which was okay, actually.  Shut up. \u201cI guess I could use someone to talk to right now.\u201d \"Well, Fal learned that standing there for others help, pon. Take the time you need to talk... If you regret, Fal will understand that don't you feel comfortable or ready to let it out, pon\" Who would feel comfortable talking about that? \"...Okay.\" Dotty raises their head from their wing, still looking away from Fal.  \"It involves Doc and a friend of mine, Wolfbell.\" Dotty takes a deep breath. Tries to hide the pain in their voice.  \"Doc tried to experiment on Wolfbell. And she agreed to it... without telling me. And when she did tell me, it was already too late. So Doc and I had an argument. And as usual, he won.\u201d \u201cI just... I can never win. I can never win against him.\" Dotty's words disconcerted Fal, who was completely paralyzed. He remembers that person, Wolfbell... And the Dark Matter thag tried to... Eat him He recognized the rarity that Wolfbell is, but Fal recognized that she is a living being. She's just a child! Hearing how someone... Even for someone with a thirst for knowledge like Fal, that's crossing the line And the argument...  Seriously, how many deja vu Fal has already?  Fal understood that. Maybe it wasn't exactly the same, but he could definitely relate \"... Even for someone with a thirst for knowledge, that's crossing the line... Maybe Fal is not in the right, and you can correct Fal if that's the case, pon. Does he always end up winning by bringing up something against you, pon? Or do they measure their words in such a way that you end up being a pawn on their chess board, pon?\" That was too much... \"... The point is: This \"Doc\" sounds like that kind of person... Although Fal always had wrong ideas about people, pon\" Snow White used to say that Fal was being dramatic. Several people came to Fal because he needed to apologize to Shade, as if he was not a danger and more like an injured child \"When we get into arguments at home, Doc always uses the same excuse: everything he does, he does to protect me. And when I point out that it isn't true, he brings up... something that I don't like talking about. And he always wins.\" \"That's playing dirty... Fal recognise that there are people who would do everything for what they care about, but... Pon...\" Fal hesitated for a few seconds before sighing nervously. His tail surrounded Dotty and brought them close to his body, like if he was giving them a hug. Fal stumbled over his words, but finally managed to let go of what he had \"P-Protecting others is important, but THAT is not the way, pon...\" \"I just... I want to leave. I want to run away from him.\" \"But... Where will you go, pon...?\" Maybe they could go with Fal? That doesn't sound like a good idea, fish \"I don't know. I'll probably just live on my own.\" \"... There's nothing that can make you change your mind, right, pon?\" Fal sigh \"... Fal isn't going to stop you, pon... But think carefully about it... Would you, pon?\" \u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind. I want to leave. I\u2019m not coming back home, not to him. If he won\u2019t look at me, I\u2019ll stop wanting him to. I\u2019ll find someone else out in the big, \u2018dangerous\u2019 world. All I need is a plan.\u201d \"... There's a reason why he is like that or not, pon? And... Finding someone else... It wouldn't be so easy, pon... Until then... Dotty... you know how to make a meal by your own, pon?\" Fal said that he wasn't going to stop them. However, he feelt the urge to be against his own words. The thing with being a wandered was how you managed to survive with someone or alone... At least that's what Fal learned But over all of that was the mental health They can handle the loneliness if they can't find a place to stay? \"... And what about the people that are hunting you, pon?\" \"You know, I know how to do more things than most people think. I've had to take care of Doc sometimes. Which he never acknowledges. But hey, when I've gone away, maybe he'll finally notice me. Or, the lack of me.\" The idea of \u200b\u200bleaving someone behind upset Fal but this person Dotty was talking about was anything except nice, at least in their own words. Going to the point of running away is proof of that!  But Fal was lost. What should Fal do? Part of him supported them while the other didn't want that  He don't have an answer  Fal shuddered at this thought. Fal had no answer. How? Fal is a Waiter! Obviously he had to have an answer! He just... Needs to think calmly  Fal separated from Dotty and resumed floating. He seemed deep in thought but spared a glance at Dotty \"...That... Fal guess it's good, at least the experience was of some use, right, pon? On a more serious note... Please think about it calmly. You can also count on with Fal for anything, pon\" \"I will. I'll give it some thought. Th... thanks.\" \"You're a good friend.\" Upon hearing the words \"good friend\" Fal smiled. His constellations shone with its emotion  So, the feeling is mutual!  The others always told him that he didn't require verbal confirmation to know if someone was his friend... Fal considered almost all of these new faces as friends... But for them to see him as a friend... Is an topic aside that is falling on THEIR criteria, not Fal's \"Well... You're a good friend too! Ignoring this burning of course. How do you feel, pon?\" \"Actually, I feel better, now that I've talked to you.\" \"That's good, pon! Now... Oh, right the another reason why Fal is here... Remember the things that Fal said when you brought Gizmo's visor, pon?\" \"What about it? I still have it, by the way.\" \"Well, Fal wanted to clarify something. Many times the answers are not to the listener's liking and Fal recognizes that perhaps it was a bit exaggerated to say that you are the result of some type of artificial selection, pon. Fal definitely does not know species with the name \"Type 2 Canary\" but it could well be something else and Fal simply does not know what it is,pon\" Was he making excuses? No, Fal felt that his chatter was a bit crude. Furthermore, he had been told many, many times that he cannot always know everything. Still, he hates having to come up and say, \"I was just giving crazy ideas, okay?\" Well, it's the same as saying that he was shuffling thoughts and not concrete things Fal looked at Dotty with intrigue... Seriously now is not the time to ask for that. Dotty is the priority right now \"... This is... Yeah, like an apologize for that rambling, pon\" \"Yeah. It was an exaggeration. I think. If anyone tried to breed my species for anything important, they failed.\"  Dotty chuckles. Still, Dotty couldn't help but wonder what \"Type 2 Canary\" even meant. Canaries are a type of bird, aren't they? But they aren't a bird. Maybe they're a bird hybrid? There are a lot of species with bird-like traits that aren't birds. And what about \"Type 1 Canaries?\" Does a Type 1 even exist? Hey, what was that saying again? Something about canaries in -- Ugh. They're starting to sound like Doc.   \"I wonder what a 'Type 2 Canary' even is...\" \"Well... You find out something, even if it's cryptic it's better than nothing, pon! Besides the answers will come sooner or later... And... That Doc... Fuck up the Doc, pon!\" It was REALLY odd to hear Fal insulting someone just like that Dotty looked at Fal, shocked, before cracking up into laughter. \u201cWow!! I never thought you were even capable of cursing!!\u201d \u201cYeah, fuck him. I can live on my own. I don\u2019t need him, right?\u201d \"Ohh believe Fal, there are many things you don't know about Fal, pon...\" Fal smiled with a hint of malice and turned in the air until he was face down. The constellations around him reunited to form a mini Dotty that greeted the gremlin. The mini Dotty encourage the original Dotty and they show their wing like if they were saying: \"Come on high five!\" \"Fal can't answer that, pon. Maybe Fal insult him, but Fal doesn't know him like you do, pon... But keep in mind that these kinds of decisions are complicated... Be careful with your steps, pon\" Dotty high-fives (or high-ones?) Fal with their wing talon.  \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll be careful. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d Fal did a somersault in the air again at the same time that the mini Dotty disappeared after receiving that high-one. Fal stood up and using one of his tassels of his scarf gave Dotty a very light blow on the head as he looked at them disapprovingly \"You are a friend. Even when Fal admits that Fal was scared of you, that was just at the beginning! Besides, can you call a relationship \"friendly\" if one doesn't care about the other, pon? Fal understand that you want freedoms... That Doc doesn't seem like the type to trust easily on the person he should take care of... Anyway... Fal want to stay, but there are things Fal have to do. However, Fal will always be available to talk if you need it, pon! Oh, and Dotty when you can... Could you try using that visor on Fal one day? of course, only when you are available, pon!\" \"Sure.  \"And speaking of visors... don't you have your own? What if...\"  Dotty points at Fal's goggles, then at themself.  \"First of all, Fal can't scan Fal. The goggles don't work on mirrors and same goes for the creations of the Dimensional Mirror, pon. Second... You're referring that Fal tries to scan you, pon?\" \n\"Yeah. Why not?\"",

        "url": "https://messageofwisdom.blogspot.com/2024/07/im-zionist-bidens-50-year-political.html",
        "summary": "By Xavier Villar  Almost three weeks after his disastrous televised debate performance, Joe Biden announced that he would not run for a second term as the president of the United States. In a letter to \"My Fellow Americans\", dated July 21, Biden expressed that, while serving as president has been \"the greatest honor of my life,\" he now believes that \"stepping down is in the best interest of my party and the country.\" In a follow-up post on X (formerly Twitter), the Democratic president expressed his \"full support and endorsement\" for vice president Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. \"Democrats, it\u2019s time to unite and defeat (Donald) Trump,\" he wrote. \"Let\u2019s do this.\" He also announced plans to address the nation later in the week to elaborate on his decision. While it appeared inevitable that Biden would withdraw from the race given his failing physical and mental health, many Democrats expressed relief over the decision. On the other hand, Republicans, who had centered their campaign on Biden, projecting him as a weak candidate who cannot even speak or walk properly, now have to look at Plan B. It\u2019s still unclear whether Biden will continue to be the president until the November general election or quit but commentators are already discussing his political legacy. His most significant foreign policy legacy is tied to Gaza. His administration will be remembered for its unwavering support for Israel\u2019s genocidal war against Gaza, which has already claimed more than 39,000 lives, most of them children and women. Biden\u2019s ironclad support for Israel was evident even before he took office. However, since October 2023, he has gone out of his way to not only support but sponsor the war against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be Jewish to be a Zionist. I consider myself a Zionist. Without Israel, no Jew in the world is safe,\u201d he declared a few months ago. As someone proud to call himself a 'Zionist,' Biden appeared determined to remain true to his commitment to Israel that goes back more than half a century. He considered his meeting with the head of the Israeli regime, Golda Meir, in 1973 as \"one of the most consequential\" of his life.\u00a0 As a young senator, Biden returned from his visit to the occupied Palestinian territories so inspired that he began to identify as a \"Zionist,\" a fervent commitment he reiterated publicly on numerous occasions, always reiterating, \"I don't believe you have to be a Jew to be a Zionist.\" In June 1982, he supported Menachem Begin's regime in its invasion of Lebanon, despite the significant civilian casualties that resulted from it. His support was so strong and enthusiastic that many had to remind him that the warring parties were obligated to protect women and children. Four years later, Biden passionately defended the substantial military aid to Israel in US Congress, terming it the \u201cbest $3 billion investment\u201d the US had made. \u201cIf Israel didn't exist, the United States would have to create one to safeguard its interests in the region,\" he said at the time, words that have been registered in the annals of history. In October 1995, Senator Biden cast his vote in favor of a Congressional resolution to relocate the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem al-Quds.\u00a0 Upon taking office in 2021, President Biden chose not to reverse Donald Trump's decision to relocate the US embassy to occupied Jerusalem al-Quds, a move enacted in 2018, nor to reopen the consulate in the occupied East Jerusalem, which had previously served as the US representation to the Palestinians. Biden, like his megalomaniac Republican predecessor, also saw the so-called \u201cIranian threat,\u201d rather than the Palestinian issue, as the primary challenge in the West Asia region. As international policy expert Bruno Ma\u00e7aes recently pointed out, the Biden administration has \u201csystematically avoided any reference to international law or human rights, instead emphasizing Israel as a close partner.\u201d \u201cTo a partner, much is permitted, including the deliberate destruction of hospitals and schools,\u201d he wrote, pointing to the US complicity in Israeli genocidal war on Gaza. \u201cWhen Russia conducted similar attacks in Ukraine, Blinken and Kirby condemned them as barbaric. Kirby described attacks on playgrounds, schools, and hospitals as \u2018utter depravity.\u2019 However, these remarks were directed at Russia, not Israel. When asked about what the Biden administration would do if Israel continued committing war crimes, the response was strikingly straightforward: \u2018We will continue to support it.\u2019\u201d Biden escalated his support for the Zionist colonial actions in Gaza to extreme levels. In a fundraising event, he candidly stated, \u201cWe are not going to do a damn thing other than protect Israel. Not a single thing.\u201d This explicit endorsement of the genocidal campaign in Gaza has led the president to perform significant rhetorical gymnastics to justify his unjustified stance. A few months ago, Biden publicly declared that \u201cIsrael should not go into Rafah,\u201d the border town with Egypt housing over a million Palestinians. However, when it became clear that Israeli forces had indeed invaded Rafah, Biden attempted to downplay the situation by stating that the soldiers had not \u201centered the city center.\u201d The Biden administration has been characterized by granting Israel total freedom to bombard and destroy lives and infrastructure in Gaza and across the occupied Palestinian territories. International Court of Justice (ICJ) this week ruled that Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestine constitutes illegal apartheid, which also serves as a devastating critique of US policy. It is noteworthy that Biden also dismissed the request by Karim Khan, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), for the arrest of Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu and military affairs minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Biden\u2019s refusal to adhere to international law has facilitated the intensification of Israel's illegal military occupation. The latest advisory opinion from the ICJ, published on Friday, emphasizes that all states have a legal obligation \"not to offer aid or assistance to maintain the situation\" created by Israel\u2019s denial of Palestinian rights. Biden\u2019s view on Palestine reflects a classic Orientalist perspective. This is evident from his statement during the so-called \"Holocaust Remembrance Week,\" where he claimed that Hamas is \"driven by an ancient desire to eliminate the Jewish people from the face of the earth.\" He distorted history and reinforced the Zionist narrative that seeks to obscure the reality of Israel's colonial occupation of Palestine, instead portraying it as a supposed \"ancient Muslim enmity against Jews.\" The issue with such statements is that they fail to justify how Hamas, a resistance group founded in Gaza in 1987 in response to Zionist occupation and settlement colonialism, could be responsible for the alleged \u201cancient hatred\u201d toward Jews in the region. The only way to interpret these statements is that they serve as a megaphone for the Zionist discourse, which attempts to present itself as an innocent victim, a victim that is allowed to bomb four countries in one day and get away with it. Biden and his administration have stood by Israel throughout the genocide in Gaza, using their veto power to prevent any ceasefire, despite public statements to the contrary. The United States vetoed up to three distinct ceasefire resolutions in the UN Security Council and rejected two proposals in the UN General Assembly. The US government spearheaded the movement to suspend funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the main aid organization in Gaza, which the Knesset has declared a \u201cterrorist organization.\u201d Israel launched a smear campaign against UNRWA, baselessly accusing it of being a front for Hamas, with the support of American media such as The New York Times, and without any challenge from the US administration regarding the disinformation campaign. It\u2019s clear that the United States has been a direct accomplice in the Israeli genocide in Gaza. The country has been actively involved in the slaughter, bombings, and attacks on defenseless civilians and has led the international effort to cut funding to the most vital aid organization in Gaza. However, to portray Biden as a messiah, just a few weeks ago, several Western media outlets reported that Biden was \"losing patience with Netanyahu.\"\u00a0 As political science professor Amal Saad explained in an interview, \"The United States has tried to achieve politically what Israel has not achieved militarily.\" In other words, the Biden administration and Israel share the same political agenda for Palestine. The only difference lies in how they communicate this agenda to their respective publics.  Xavier Villar\u00a0is a Ph.D. in Islamic Studies and researcher based in\u00a0Spain.",

Dotty...\" That answer obviously wouldn't convince anyone. Fal stopped floating and touched the ground, being quite close to Dotty. He tried to appear confident, but his concern was noticeable   \"Hey... Whatever is upsetling you... Pon... You don't have to talk about it if you don't want, pon. At least company would help, pon?\" What Fal can do? What? Dotty lowers themself and hides their face under their wing.  \"It's not your problem. I got in an argument, that's all.\" Fal murmured an \"ohh\" in response. Hesitantly he looked away and then looked back at Dotty. One of his tassels rested on Dotty's head, trying to give a bit of comfort \"You're right that's not Fal problem, but  that isn't going to stop Fal, pon. If Fal can do anything, just say it. Or even if you don't want nothing, that's ok too. The point is that Fal isn't going to leave, pon\" \"I thought so.\" Dotty sighs. \"Fine, then. Make yourself comfortable.\" At those words, Fal seemed to relax, although his concern was still notable. Fal resumed flight and circled in the air, scattering sparks. Although his movements were playful, his face remained blank. Perhaps what Fal perceived as \"comfortable\" was spinning in the air? If that was the case, it was quite childish, even for an AI Shyly, Fal tried to cheer up Dotty with some topic of interest. Fal would not ask or pressure them \"... Do you... Have any hobbies, pon? Like... Star gazing, drawing, gardening or anything, pon?\" Fal asked while he was floating upside down This is alright? Or Fal is just making things worse? \"I like drawing. I guess. Sometimes I draw in my spare time.\" \"I also like... going outside, when I can.\" Dotty mumbles, their face buried under their wing.  \"Pon... Wait, how can you draw if you don't have hands, pon? Drawing is already a difficult skill to master, and well... That makes it more complicated, pon! \" \u201c\u2026I use my talon\u2026\u201d Dotty looks a bit embarrassed. Fal nodded slowly at the answer. Seeing Dotty's reaction, he thought that perhaps he had been reckless. This was doable, and after somersaulting in the air he landed on the floor. More sparkles and stars flew around, some of them \"sticking\" to Dotty for a few seconds before disappearing. Maybe they just want silence? That would EVIDENTLY be the most logical thing. Fal thought that talking about something in particular would help, but maybe he was just acting without thinking, again Fal stood next to Dotty in complete silence. He wanted to ask several things, he wanted to help them, but again if he forced them to act or talk when it was obvious that they didn't want to, it would only aggravate the situation. For this reason, Fal held the words in his mouth and his tail surrounded Dotty but did not touch them  Dotty stayed silent.  They wanted someone to talk to. They had so much on their mind - too much. Way too much. But they didn't know how to ask, or how to begin. They weren't sure how to ask for help, but it's not like they needed help, right? \"...I got in a fight, if you're curious.\" \"Not... anything physical. It was over the phone.\" Fal turned to look at Dotty, brimming with concern at their words \"What!? You got into a fight, pon!? Tell Fal it wasn't with the people that are hunting you, pon! Or someone else wanted to harm you, pon!?\" \"It wasn't like that. It was an argument with someone at home.\"  \"Those guys are... those guys are no biggie. I can deal with them.\" \"... Pon... Even if those guys aren't the \"biggie\" as you said... More important! You can trust Fal and talk about it... Only if you want, pon... Fal isn't going to pressure, pon. Take your time or... Well, it's obvious that this doesn't have nothing to do with Fal... Fal understand that this is not of Fal's concern... But still! Fal want to support you as much as possible, pon!\" \u201cAnd by \u2018support,\u2019 you mean \u2018not leaving me alone.\u2019\u201d Which was okay, actually.  Shut up. \u201cI guess I could use someone to talk to right now.\u201d \"Well, Fal learned that standing there for others help, pon. Take the time you need to talk... If you regret, Fal will understand that don't you feel comfortable or ready to let it out, pon\" Who would feel comfortable talking about that? \"...Okay.\" Dotty raises their head from their wing, still looking away from Fal.  \"It involves Doc and a friend of mine, Wolfbell.\" Dotty takes a deep breath. Tries to hide the pain in their voice.  \"Doc tried to experiment on Wolfbell. And she agreed to it... without telling me. And when she did tell me, it was already too late. So Doc and I had an argument. And as usual, he won.\u201d \u201cI just... I can never win. I can never win against him.\" Dotty's words disconcerted Fal, who was completely paralyzed. He remembers that person, Wolfbell... And the Dark Matter thag tried to... Eat him He recognized the rarity that Wolfbell is, but Fal recognized that she is a living being. She's just a child! Hearing how someone... Even for someone with a thirst for knowledge like Fal, that's crossing the line And the argument...  Seriously, how many deja vu Fal has already?  Fal understood that. Maybe it wasn't exactly the same, but he could definitely relate \"... Even for someone with a thirst for knowledge, that's crossing the line... Maybe Fal is not in the right, and you can correct Fal if that's the case, pon. Does he always end up winning by bringing up something against you, pon? Or do they measure their words in such a way that you end up being a pawn on their chess board, pon?\" That was too much... \"... The point is: This \"Doc\" sounds like that kind of person... Although Fal always had wrong ideas about people, pon\" Snow White used to say that Fal was being dramatic. Several people came to Fal because he needed to apologize to Shade, as if he was not a danger and more like an injured child \"When we get into arguments at home, Doc always uses the same excuse: everything he does, he does to protect me. And when I point out that it isn't true, he brings up... something that I don't like talking about. And he always wins.\" \"That's playing dirty... Fal recognise that there are people who would do everything for what they care about, but... Pon...\" Fal hesitated for a few seconds before sighing nervously. His tail surrounded Dotty and brought them close to his body, like if he was giving them a hug. Fal stumbled over his words, but finally managed to let go of what he had \"P-Protecting others is important, but THAT is not the way, pon...\" \"I just... I want to leave. I want to run away from him.\" \"But... Where will you go, pon...?\" Maybe they could go with Fal? That doesn't sound like a good idea, fish \"I don't know. I'll probably just live on my own.\" \"... There's nothing that can make you change your mind, right, pon?\" Fal sigh \"... Fal isn't going to stop you, pon... But think carefully about it... Would you, pon?\" \u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind. I want to leave. I\u2019m not coming back home, not to him. If he won\u2019t look at me, I\u2019ll stop wanting him to. I\u2019ll find someone else out in the big, \u2018dangerous\u2019 world. All I need is a plan.\u201d \"... There's a reason why he is like that or not, pon? And... Finding someone else... It wouldn't be so easy, pon... Until then... Dotty... you know how to make a meal by your own, pon?\" Fal said that he wasn't going to stop them. However, he feelt the urge to be against his own words. The thing with being a wandered was how you managed to survive with someone or alone... At least that's what Fal learned But over all of that was the mental health They can handle the loneliness if they can't find a place to stay? \"... And what about the people that are hunting you, pon?\" \"You know, I know how to do more things than most people think. I've had to take care of Doc sometimes. Which he never acknowledges. But hey, when I've gone away, maybe he'll finally notice me. Or, the lack of me.\" The idea of \u200b\u200bleaving someone behind upset Fal but this person Dotty was talking about was anything except nice, at least in their own words. Going to the point of running away is proof of that!  But Fal was lost. What should Fal do? Part of him supported them while the other didn't want that  He don't have an answer  Fal shuddered at this thought. Fal had no answer. How? Fal is a Waiter! Obviously he had to have an answer! He just... Needs to think calmly  Fal separated from Dotty and resumed floating. He seemed deep in thought but spared a glance at Dotty \"...That... Fal guess it's good, at least the experience was of some use, right, pon? On a more serious note... Please think about it calmly. You can also count on with Fal for anything, pon\" \"I will. I'll give it some thought. Th... thanks.\" \"You're a good friend.\" Upon hearing the words \"good friend\" Fal smiled. His constellations shone with its emotion  So, the feeling is mutual!  The others always told him that he didn't require verbal confirmation to know if someone was his friend... Fal considered almost all of these new faces as friends... But for them to see him as a friend... Is an topic aside that is falling on THEIR criteria, not Fal's \"Well... You're a good friend too! Ignoring this burning of course. How do you feel, pon?\" \"Actually, I feel better, now that I've talked to you.\" \"That's good, pon! Now... Oh, right the another reason why Fal is here... Remember the things that Fal said when you brought Gizmo's visor, pon?\" \"What about it? I still have it, by the way.\" \"Well, Fal wanted to clarify something. Many times the answers are not to the listener's liking and Fal recognizes that perhaps it was a bit exaggerated to say that you are the result of some type of artificial selection, pon. Fal definitely does not know species with the name \"Type 2 Canary\" but it could well be something else and Fal simply does not know what it is,pon\" Was he making excuses? No, Fal felt that his chatter was a bit crude. Furthermore, he had been told many, many times that he cannot always know everything. Still, he hates having to come up and say, \"I was just giving crazy ideas, okay?\" Well, it's the same as saying that he was shuffling thoughts and not concrete things Fal looked at Dotty with intrigue... Seriously now is not the time to ask for that. Dotty is the priority right now \"... This is... Yeah, like an apologize for that rambling, pon\" \"Yeah. It was an exaggeration. I think. If anyone tried to breed my species for anything important, they failed.\"  Dotty chuckles. Still, Dotty couldn't help but wonder what \"Type 2 Canary\" even meant. Canaries are a type of bird, aren't they? But they aren't a bird. Maybe they're a bird hybrid? There are a lot of species with bird-like traits that aren't birds. And what about \"Type 1 Canaries?\" Does a Type 1 even exist? Hey, what was that saying again? Something about canaries in -- Ugh. They're starting to sound like Doc.   \"I wonder what a 'Type 2 Canary' even is...\" \"Well... You find out something, even if it's cryptic it's better than nothing, pon! Besides the answers will come sooner or later... And... That Doc... Fuck up the Doc, pon!\" It was REALLY odd to hear Fal insulting someone just like that Dotty looked at Fal, shocked, before cracking up into laughter. \u201cWow!! I never thought you were even capable of cursing!!\u201d \u201cYeah, fuck him. I can live on my own. I don\u2019t need him, right?\u201d \"Ohh believe Fal, there are many things you don't know about Fal, pon...\" Fal smiled with a hint of malice and turned in the air until he was face down. The constellations around him reunited to form a mini Dotty that greeted the gremlin. The mini Dotty encourage the original Dotty and they show their wing like if they were saying: \"Come on high five!\" \"Fal can't answer that, pon. Maybe Fal insult him, but Fal doesn't know him like you do, pon... But keep in mind that these kinds of decisions are complicated... Be careful with your steps, pon\" Dotty high-fives (or high-ones?) Fal with their wing talon.  \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll be careful. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d Fal did a somersault in the air again at the same time that the mini Dotty disappeared after receiving that high-one. Fal stood up and using one of his tassels of his scarf gave Dotty a very light blow on the head as he looked at them disapprovingly \"You are a friend. Even when Fal admits that Fal was scared of you, that was just at the beginning! Besides, can you call a relationship \"friendly\" if one doesn't care about the other, pon? Fal understand that you want freedoms... That Doc doesn't seem like the type to trust easily on the person he should take care of... Anyway... Fal want to stay, but there are things Fal have to do. However, Fal will always be available to talk if you need it, pon! Oh, and Dotty when you can... Could you try using that visor on Fal one day? of course, only when you are available, pon!\" \n\"Sure.  \"And speaking of visors... don't you have your own? What if...\"  Dotty points at Fal's goggles, then at themself.",

        "summary": "Housing and food are health care: How new Medicaid rules in 8 states stand to help the most vulnerable\nAmericans\u2019 health care experiences are as varied as their backgrounds. For some, their income, housing, transportation, and other factors that shape their everyday lives can be obstacles to accessing much-needed health care. \nHowever, recent changes to federal health care policies could eliminate some of these barriers. The federal agency over Medicaid provides health care to more than 76 million adults and children, some of whom may benefit from new programs being enacted in several states to meet their unique socioeconomic needs. \nFoothold Technology analyzed resources from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and KFF, as well as plans from state health departments, to illustrate how states are implementing new guidance on addressing social conditions inextricably tied to health, known as health-related social needs, within their communities. \nHRSNs are the supports needed to overcome what are known as social determinants of health, or the nonmedical factors that impact health outcomes and care. The World Health Organization defines SDH as \u201cthe conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age.\u201d SDH came to light most recently when the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the U.S., highlighting how income, working conditions, and access to nutritious foods\u2014or lack thereof\u2014can affect public health in a time of crisis. \nBlack, Hispanic, and Indigenous communities were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic for various reasons that didn\u2019t stem from the virus itself. Decades of being underserved by health care systems, food insecurity, overrepresentation in customer-facing service jobs, as well as the chronic stress of racism and earning lower wages on average than their white counterparts, made many people of color more vulnerable to the virus. \nSocioeconomic factors can influence as much as a 50% variation in health outcomes for Americans, meaning improving underlying issues like housing instability could be half the battle in helping someone living with diabetes live a longer, healthier life, for example. In recent years, the federal government has started to adopt wide-ranging responses to address those issues, including through new guidance from the CMS, with the potential to impact more than tens of millions of people.",

        "url": "https://kmdvm.blogspot.com/2024/07/letter-to-upenn-veterinary-teaching.html",
        "summary": "\u00a0Access to Care There are those of us who live our lives with the hope that our pets will find us worthy. We spend the majority of our time giving gestures of thanks for all that they give us, without asking or expecting anything in return. We feel humbled by how little their loyalty costs, and yet we still want to offer more knowing it can't repay all that they give us. The relationship between ourselves and our pets, the ones who share the most painful, joyous and raucous moments of our lives with, is unsurpassed. Our pets are our truest, most trusted, most faithful companions. Most of us would chose them over any, or every other human alive, even those we call a relative. This, this single sentiment, has forged many a veterinarian to face arduous years of study and turmoil. It, all of it, is worth those quiet, unseen moments with them for that one soft purr, a gentle wag, a velvet ear and wet nose. For these we would, and do, give everything.\u00a0 Jenn and Johnny Cash Johnny Cash was the beloved dog of our hospital manager Jenn. He was growing older and like most large shepherds, was struggling with issues associated with his breed and age. He needed help getting up, staying up, and his self- assigned guard duties pressure suffered as these progressed. When he needed help she was determined to do everything for him. During the course of almost a week he went from not feeling well to unable to stand, eat or interact. Over that time he was given an immense amount care from the staff of our clinic. When one of our own is not doing well the hive swarms around them to lend a hand. This is a story of love and the dedication/devotion that all pet parents feel when their pets life is tenuously suspended on the precipice of life meeting end of life. Veterinarians, those of us in the sweaty, grueling, chaotic trenches of day-to-day medicine life forget this. We lose sight how much we are needed. How much power we yield, and how devastating the loss of our companions can be when we fail to live and deliver the purpose our knowledge and skills provide. There is the potential loss of a life with every patient we see. We veterinarians all know that. We are so used to it that for some it is an acceptable, albeit an inevitable sequela that it permits a degree of indifference some call a \"healthy boundary.\" It allows us to practice without prejudice and without emptying our own internal well so thoroughly that we can go on to help others. What we forget is what the loss of these patients does to their parents. The void of losing their unsurpassed love, and the living through the phases of grief that loss requires. But, the real pain of too many of these situations is the cold, indifferent manner that we treat those coming to us for help. This is the place that vetmed has gotten itself to. We did not come here to be this. We must never forget why we are here, and what kind of legacy we are building as we walk each footstep of our professional life.  Within 1 week Johnny Cash had 5 veterinary examinations, 2 ultrasounds, 4 lab works, 2 internal medicine teleconferences, 3 x-rays, and two radiology reviews. He had every person at our very busy practice working to help him.\u00a0 When his disease eluded us, and he continued to slip away, we decided we needed more help. We did for him what we would do for every case we cannot figure out fully, we referred him to those who could. In our part of the country the most competent place we can send a patient is the University of Pennsylvania Veterinary Teaching Hospital.\u00a0  The veterinary teaching hospital is the foundation of the crucible of all that a veterinarian holds as the building blocks to all that we are and all that we could hope to be. There is no other place that holds greater power nor greater minds. These institutions employ the most notable, credible and wizard-like masters. For the greatest medical minds of our world, these 30-odd colleges are all that we offer for the best of our abilities. They build us, each of us, and for that we are forever indebted. They also hold unparalleled optimism for the cases we cannot heal. With great power comes great responsibility. This, this is where the failure of all that we hope to be lies. This is where we sent Johnny Cash as our last hope to help him, and his beloved mom, Jenn.\u00a0 This is the communication sent back and forth over Johnny Cash's care. The first is Jenn's letter about her concerns and experience when she brought her very sick, very fragile, very much loved Johnny Cash to UPenn. What concerned her the most, as we look back on this, was how hard she had to advocate for her dog. How hard she had to insist on being heard, and how, if she hadn't been an \"insider\" and hadn't had me on the phone (3 times), during her stay at the hospital. What strikes me as the most unacceptable part of her experience is that she wasn't treated as the instrumental part of the patient care experience as she should have been. This is a teaching hospital. The safest place for anyone to be. The place where mistakes are used as the crucial crucible of molding the future veterinarians. It is the place where asking\u00a0 questions, challenging all aspects of medicine, and putting the patient above all else should happen.\u00a0  Good Morning, I am sorry for the delay, as its been only a week since I lost my beloved dog and articulating our experience in a coherent manner does not come easy.\u00a0\u00a0 I do want to preface this email by saying that I have utilized both Ryan Hospital (2019) and New Bolton (2021) in the past and was incredibly pleased with my experience and the care that my animals received. We were treated with respect and compassion. This experience was so outside of the norm I know from Penn.\u00a0 As stated in Dr Magnifico's email, she had called ahead as the referring veterinarian to the Emergency Department hoping for a second set of eyes on the case. We were asked how far away we were to which we stated about 2 hours. Records were forwarded outlining all we had done in our clinic and Johnny Cash was loaded into my car on a stretcher. I kissed his head and promised that we were trying to help him.\u00a0 I arrived at UPenn on 1/23/2024 around 3: 15 pm. The stretcher was loaded onto a gurney to take him back. I gave my information at the desk and signed all consents. Our stretcher was brought out along with the blankets that he had soiled.\u00a0 Around 4:20ish I met with a 4th year student to give Johnny Cash's history.\u00a0 Around 6:30ish I finally met with the attending to go over her assessment, more than 3 hours after we arrived. I was told that we needed to start \"at square one\" with diagnostics. It was recommended that fluid be pulled off his abdomen for assessment. I was told his pulses were low. There was concern for cancer and that he would need to go to the ICU. I was told a urinary catheter would be placed. I questioned this as he was not outputting urine despite being on fluids and was told this was to keep him clean. My estimate to start was $4,000 - $6,000. I was a bit in shock as we had called ahead to see if we could send him for a second set of eyes, along with record of everything we had done in our clinic over the prior four days. I wasn't sure why we would need to start at square one. When I questioned this I was told nothing was open at this time to do any diagnostics, ultrasound, etc. I questioned why we were told to come up, two hours away, if there was no ability to provide the services that were requested. The attending told me that she would look through the referral log to see if there was anything recorded there, which she stated there was not. I was given the option to return in the morning when we could have the necessary testing which would eliminate the cost for overnight care and likely be around$2,000 but result in a total of 8 hours of driving with a dog who was in critical condition. After a lot of back and forth we agreed to at least pull off the abdominal fluid before we left. Some time around 7:30 pm his abdomen was tapped. Around 7:43 pm we were given the news that the fluid was septic. My estimate changed from $8,000 to $10,000 to start as he would need an emergency ultrasound and surgery. I made the decision to take him home to euthanize at our clinic in the morning. As a pet owner, and someone in the veterinary industry, I have several concerns;  I watched as less critical pets had histories taken quickly. They quickly met with an attending and\u00a0 were even discharged before I had even met with the attending. If my pet were so critical an ICU was recommended shouldn't he have been assessed before the easy \"in and out\" cases? (Specifically a Golden Retriever with an eye injury stuck out in my mind, (although there were others). Are cases not assessed for urgency? (Maybe if mine had he would have gotten the services he needed before clinicians left for the day?). Your own website states \"Patients are seen on a medical priority basis. Waiting times for clients can vary depending on the caseload at the time of presentation. All patients in life-threatening situations are immediately brought to the treatment area, where the emergency clinician performs a physical examination and provides emergency stabilization.\" Given our timeline this does not seem to be accurate.I was told that my pet could receive \"better care\" in the ICU than what he was receiving at home overnight. Yes, my dog was hospitalized at home overnight, under the care of someone who works in the veterinary industry and under the direct supervision of a veterinarian. These were the exact words used, and they stung.My dying dog was given no pain meds, even when we knew his abdomen was septic and I stated he would be euthanized in the morning at our clinic. A dying dog who was septic was discharged and given no pain meds.A week later Johnny Cash's records have yet to be sent to Jarrettsville Vet, I am glad no next steps were hinging on this.While I could have likely come up with $4,000 I was told that the $4-$6k estimate was \"to start\" I work in the veterinary industry because I love animals, unfortunately a love for money does not align with a life in our industry. I do not have unlimited resources. $8-10k to start was completely outside of reachable, and I fear this would be the case for many. I know most of our clients would not be able to manage thisI have read over your Client Rights on your website, (see here), Johnny Cash and I were failed at every bullet point within those rights. As humans we have evolved to love our pets as a part of our family. We love them in many cases more than we love many humans. We often grieve their loss more than that of a human as well. Somewhere along the way many in the veterinary industry seem to be capitalizing on this love and in turn emergency care is becoming out of reach for most. If this care is out of reach for someone in our industry I fear what that means for our clients. I am grateful that I brought my dog back home. He was taken in for an emergency exploratory surgery at our clinic as a last effort to save him, and although that was not possible, I did get my answer (diagnosis) and with that came peace in letting my beloved companion slip away peacefully. I was only given this because I work at Jarrettsville Vet. My heart breaks for the average pet owner who would have had to make the decision to let their pet go amidst an impossible starting estimate, never knowing the diagnosis.\u00a0 While we worry about mental health in our industry the reality is there is a pet owner who is more often than not, loves their pet at the other end of the leash or the carrier who deserves to be treated with compassion as well. I hope relaying my experience somehow helps others; I have the unique perspective from both ends of the spectrum - someone in the veterinary industry and a pet owner. Thank you for your time,Jennifer There were two phone conversations that occurred as a result of this letter. One with the social worker to better describe the care and client experience Jenn received. The second phone call was with the Emergency Hospital coordinator and the an ER clinician. It was not helpful to Jenn, nor in any way reassuring to me that what happened to her and Johnny Cash, wouldn't happen again this evening. There was an apology for Jenn's loss, a defensive posture that he was well cared for at their facility, and a lot of excuses and firm language that they are compassionate, they do offer a spectrum of care with affordable options being given when clients have financial constraints, and hurtful commentary from two veterinarians who want to stand by all of the reasons Jenn's concerns were wrong. It was a shocking phone call that further reinforces the state of veterinary medicine in this country. After we got off the phone with UPenn and after we had put all of our thoughts, grief and taken the time to bring Johnny Cash's case into the learning and call for concern with the state of vetmed, we decided to write this. Jarrettsville Vet never puts a pets ability to have a chance at a treatable outcome, and a clients ability to have hope behind anything other than our mission to Always Be Kind. This is where medicine starts. Where it lives and the only place it can succeed. There needs to be a better place for the conversations to start then the estimate.\u00a0    The letter reads; Dear Referral Facilities, \u00a0 \u00a0 We hope that this letter finds you well. We are writing in regards to the patients and clients of Jarrettsville Veterinary Center. It's our hope and goal to honor our promise to stand by them in doing what is best for their beloved pets.  \u00a0 \u00a0 We understand that emergency situations can arise unexpectedly and we want to ensure that the best care is provided to our clients/patients during these times. We also believe that every life is precious and deserves to be treated with compassion and respect. For this reason, and any other, should a decision ever need to be made to euthanize a mutual pet due to financial constraints please reach out to our facility.\u00a0 We want to make it clear we do not condone this type of practice at our facility.  \u00a0 \u00a0 We are dedicated to providing the best care possible regardless of financial constraints. We believe that every pet deserves a chance at a happy and healthy life. We will work with you and our client to find a solution that is in the best interest for all involved. Dr. Magnifico is happy to include her email and personal cell phone number to the DVM's and practice management staff to offer help when needed.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Kindest Regards, \u00a0 \u00a0 Krista Magnifico, DVM \u00a0 \u00a0 Owner Jarrettsville Veterinary Center  This letter was sent to about a dozen referral and emergency practices within a 2 hour drive from our clinic. As of today we have received these replies.\u00a0 The UPenn Ryan Veterinary Hospital and Mason-Dixon ER in Shrewsbury, Pa. and the Animal Emergency Hospital in Bel Air Md This week I tried, again, to refer a patient to UPenn. I was not able to provide the transfer without an authorization that the client would be able to afford the projected estimate even though, as in the case above, the diagnosis, diagnostics, and treatment plan were unknown.\u00a0      \u00a0 School of Veterinary Medicine Department of Clinical Sciences & Advanced Medicine \u2013 Philadelphia 3900 Delancey Street Philadelphia, PA 19104 \u00a0 \u00a0 July 11, 2024 \u00a0 Dear Dr. Magnifico, \u00a0 Thank you for reaching out and for your thoughtful message. We appreciate Jarrettsville Veterinary Center's commitment to providing compassionate care to all pets, regardless of financial constraints. \u00a0 At Penn Vet, we share your values and dedication to the well-being of our mutual patients. We understand the importance of ensuring that every pet receives the best possible care, especially during emergency situations. Your offer to collaborate and find solutions to avoid euthanasia due to financial difficulties is truly commendable. We will certainly reach out to your facility if we encounter any situations where financial constraints might affect the decision-making process for a pet's care. We kindly ask that you discuss estimates with your clients and notify us of any financial concerns when referring a client to us. As we have many clinicians that rotate through our emergency service, this will be a critical step in communications to ensure that the emergency care team helping your clients understand the terms of your support and that nothing is lost in the transfer of information. Having your contact information will be incredibly helpful, and we appreciate your willingness to financially assist clients in such circumstances. \u00a0 Thank you once again for your partnership and for your unwavering commitment to the health and happiness of the pets we collectively serve. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sincerely, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PennVet -Ryan Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania  I will be reaching out once again to UPenn to discuss the practice of putting estimates at the gates. The estimates are formulated based on the referring veterinarians findings and suspicions. This estimate is based on many possible scenarios and presumed diagnostics, with presumed treatment plans. All of understand that this is difficult to cement into a narrow dollar figure. What it costs most clients is the fearful restraint that a large dollar figure, a potentially looming poor prognosis and the healthcare plan starting out, and being presented with financial influence at the welcome mat is both unkind, uncaring and costing care we can in all and every case negotiate and compromise. It seems, with all of the recent cases that we have sent, that the gates ability to open rely on the estimate. How can a learning institution practice medicine to train its students who will provide care to all kinds of clients with the admission set at worst case?. If they truly want to provide all clients options and follow the standards we were all taught, then these estimates have no place in greeting clients and patients BEFORE they are seen. I have been a private practice veterinarian and practice owner for 20 years. There has never been one case that we have not helped in a manner that doesn't put the patient first, and the client feeling as if they are the at the center of everything we do, and that every patient has a team based approach. There are many points of Jenn's letter that I understand as a veterinarian that are harder to explain to a client. The timeline. A clients idea of the passage of time is very different from the veterinarians. While I try to stay on time, Keep every client apprised of the time I am taking and explain/excuse why it is taking so long. It is inevitably impossible to be able to complete a complicated case, with all that we have to do, discern, digest, diagnose and report. Time in the clinic, on the floor, with a difficult case seems like seconds while the client is sitting for hours. We are always. always running behind, over extended, and never is there a moment where we sit down, relax, or eat, drink, or even pee. I will give them the time frame. I empathize. The idea that any of us read every piece of paper, every diagnostic, each step another vet has taken, well, in reality we don't. We don't have time. And, after all, everyone, every other vet is is a charlatan. Don't waste your time reading over some half-wits work,, they couldn't figure it out, why waste your time looking at what they did. No, what really lights me up is that they treated her like she was just another client. Just another replaceable mom, with another dying pet. She is a mom who loves her dog. She is the client we all worked so hard to get into vet school so we could take care of. She is the medium of all of our dreams. She almost walked out because they couldn't/wouldn't see her past their estimate. What an utter failure to even attempt to be anything of value. It doesn't matter what you are capable of if you cannot remember why you are here.",

        "summary": "Addressing concerns about inappropriate content, misinformation, privacy, and security BY\u00a0MB LIFESTYLEJul 25, 2024 07:22 PM\u00a0\u00a0  Social media has enabled people to connect across different worlds, communicate globally, share information and ideas, express opinions, and engage in diverse discussions. Additionally, it has made news, entertainment, and other resources more accessible. One of today's most popular social apps is TikTok. Although it might seem like a platform solely for entertainment, it has significantly transformed the social media landscape. \u201cTikTok is really about being authentic. And that's the first and foremost thing that makes us different from other social media platform. It is a window that allows users to see what\u2019s happening around the world,\u201d said a representive from the TikTok Singapore transparency and accountability team.\u00a0 Members of Philippine media visiting TikTok Singapore\u2019s officeA media tour on July 5 at the TikTok office in One Raffles Quay, Singapore, provided an in-depth look at its various functions, how it differs from other social media apps, the behind-the-scenes processes to keep users safe, and how TikTok addresses concerns about inappropriate content, misinformation, privacy, and security. Showcasing Filipino creators The tour began by highlighting Filipino TikTok content creators who have had a significant impact on many lives through a gallery-style exhibit. From arts to sports, current events, and culture, TikTok has paved the way for the rise of influencers. People who once had no platform can now share their stories and provide content for various purposes. It's no surprise that the Philippines is among the nations with the highest TikTok audience. According to datareportal.com, the Philippines had an estimated 49.09 million TikTok users aged 18 and above in early 2024. Many Filipino content creators have found great success with their impressive creative content. Inka Magnaye, for example, discusses body positivity, mental health awareness, and other topics that are difficult to address, especially in the Philippine setting. Other notable creators include food content creator \u201cLumpia Queen\u201d Abi Marquez, best known for her lumpia-wrapped dishes, and Arshie Larga, the \u201cfriendly neighborhood pharmacist.\u201d These accomplished creators are familiar names to most Filipinos. Beyond providing entertainment and information, TikTok is also an excellent platform for creators to earn money, expand their portfolios, connect with stakeholders, and support their businesses. It serves as a valuable platform for informing and educating people. Protecting the community With its mission to inspire creativity and bring joy, TikTok demonstrated how they ensure users\u2019 safety and protection. \u201cWe use technology and human interface to moderate content and promote a positive environment,\u201d said TikTok Outreach and Partnerships Manager KahnJi Weerachaising. The team walked us through TikTok\u2019s community guidelines, policies, and content moderation process. We participated in interactive demonstrations at their moderation workstation, gaining a deeper understanding of TikTok\u2019s safety systems.\u00a0 Using AI, TikTok detects harmful objects, dangerous acts, and unsafe videos that could be restricted under their policies and guidelines. The machines used for moderation are trained to recognize harmful objects and dangerous postures. Content moderation involves a two-part process. The first part is auto-moderation by a machine, and the second part involves staff members reviewing videos to filter out dangerous content. Actual people ensure that every piece of content meets community guidelines. This secondary process examines the context of videos to determine if they contain harmful content. Safety control features The third part of the tour focused on safety controls, particularly for teens and families. To further protect its users, especially younger ones, TikTok has set a 12+ rating in app stores, allowing parents to block or limit specific apps on their child's phone using device-based controls. Only users aged 16 and above can send or receive direct messages. Another feature is \u201cFamily Pairing,\u201d which lets a parent or guardian link their TikTok account to their child\u2019s, enabling them to manage various content and privacy settings. Accounts for users under 18 are automatically set to a 60-minute daily screen time limit. \u201cBy protecting the safety of our users, we create a positive environment for our communities, and we remain committed to protecting users on TikTok,\u201d said Weerachaising.

Take it from a former HR person\u2026 this goes double right now.  I just spent some time putting in some job applications myself (not for HR, lol) and got about 15 interviews. And idk if it\u2019s because of COVID uncertainty or if places just don\u2019t fucking care anymore because they know people are desperate for work, but the amount of straight up illegal shit\u00a0my interviewers asked me was appalling.  (That\u2019s not even counting the questions that were technically\u00a0legal but clearly fishing for information they\u2019re not legally allowed to ask.) A tame example? Two questions into a phone interview, the guy on the other end of the line asked:\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  I said\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d - giving him a chance to rethink that.  He didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  \u201cSir, you are not allowed to ask me that question.\u201d  \u201cWell, I want to know. I\u2019m asking.\u201d  \u201cAnd you\u2019re legally not allowed to ask me that. I\u2019m not required to tell you my age.\u201d  At that point, I guess he managed to remember an old HR bulletin or something (I hope to god he wasn\u2019t actually HR himself), and he said,\u00a0\u201cWell, I need to know if you\u2019re over the age of 18.\u201d (Which is what he should have asked in the first place\u2026 or not, since that was in the application that he could have read.)  \u201cYes. I\u2019m over the age of 18.\u201d\u00a0  And we moved on. Two questions later, he tried another illegal question. I called him on it again and ended the interview, citing that a workplace with such a clear disregard for the law, especially upon first contact with a potential employee, was not going to be a good fit. (They offered me the job anyway, lol. I didn\u2019t send a thank-you or a response.) At a different interview, the majority of questions were\u00a0\u201cfishing\u201d questions - just looking for that info they\u2019re not actually allowed to ask. (This person was also either not really HR or an HR person who was exceptionally bad at their job.) I could tell they were getting frustrated when I dodged answering the personal stuff, and they actually got extremely\u00a0upset when I mentioned later in the interview (re: less relevant work experience) I had worked in HR. They were super flustered for the remainder of our time, and I watched them skip over questions on their sheet they had clearly planned on asking. They KNEW they were being sketchy and were counting on me not knowing anything about HR - or my rights - and so they got upset when I did.  These were super tame\u00a0examples. I\u2019m begging you, if you\u2019re job searching right now, PLEASE\u00a0know your rights. Please know what interviewers are allowed to ask.  Please don\u2019t volunteer information or elaborate more than you\u2019re required to about personal things. Save your words (and everyone\u2019s time) by elaborating why you\u2019re good for the position/what you can do.  I may create a resource list on this shit later but PLEASE PLEASE KNOW THIS STUFF BEFORE YOU TALK TO AN EMPLOYER. This goes for anywhere you\u2019re interviewing as well as your current employer. This also goes for HR. HR may be the person you go to when shitty stuff happens, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re your friend (or competent).  They don\u2019t need to know your age (beyond 16+, 18+, or 21+, depending on the job). They don\u2019t need to know your medical history. (For the love of god, do NOT answer the\u00a0\u201chave you been diagnosed with depression?\u201d question.) They don\u2019t need to know if you have kids or whatever. They don\u2019t need to know a LOT of those things that may appear on an application, including your veteran status, whether you\u2019re on/have been on unemployment, etc. They\u2019re not entitled to know specifics about your transportation (unless you\u2019re using that transportation for the job, like Uber/delivery drivers). Look this up for your state/the job\u2019s state.  Beware questions like\u00a0\u201cWhat year did you graduate?\u201d if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t put dates on your resume (I just put amount of time spent at employers, not dates of employment). They\u2019re fishing for your age. It\u2019s \u201cOh, you know, 100 years ago,\u201d if you feel comfortable making a joke, or\u00a0\u201cAbout [generic number, like 5 or 10] years ago\u201d if not.  Also beware things like the\u00a0\u201cWhat do you do in your free time?\u201d question, even if you already work there. This is not a friendly getting-to-know-you question. This is a basis for judgement. Not up to an invisible standard? They\u2019re going to be biased against you for pay raises, promotions, etc. Mention kids/lots of family/social engagements? That\u2019s a tick against you for not being the kind of person who lives to work (yes, it\u2019s gross and stupid). Mention lots of solitary things? Cool, that\u2019s their mental note to ask more from you because you\u2019re\u00a0\u201cnot doing anything anyway.\u201d By all means, be friendly with your coworkers/talk about shared interests if you want, but it is none\u00a0of your boss\u2019s business, and be aware what could get back to them.\u00a0  Don\u2019t. Tell. Employers. Shit.   \nWe wrote up a handy list of those illegal questions here: 10 Questions You Should Never Be Asked in a Job Interview\u00a0 \n\n\nHopefully people already know this by now, but I saw way too often back when I worked in retail. Don\u2019t add your coworkers or boss on social media. Yes, your coworkers too. You don\u2019t want to accidentally say something to them or have them see a post and mention it to your boss.

        "summary": "STORY AT-A-GLANCEA recently published study was one of the first of its kind to distinguish what particular interactions with dogs (e.g., feeding, playing, grooming) are the most beneficial to human moods and concentration levelsThe results showed that playing with and walking your dog can bring about a relaxed and wakeful state; massaging, grooming, or playing with your dog can heighten your concentration without increasing your stressHopefully, this research can trigger future studies into the correlation between types of activities and their brain effects, potentially helping to develop different types of interventions for people suffering from different types of psychological woesAnimal-assisted interventions (e.g., therapy dogs) are used in a wide variety of scenarios such as hospitals and schools to help reduce anxiety, relieve stress, and promote feelings of trust. Traditionally, research into the potential benefits of animal interactions often takes a holistic approach, comparing peoples mood or hormone levels before and after spending time with a service animal. The drawback to this approach is that it doesn\u2019t distinguish between different types of interactions, such as feeding, playing with, or grooming an animal, to further our understanding of how these activities affect mood. Recently, a team of researchers at Konkuk University in South Korea set out to do a deeper dive into the subject, the results of which were published in the journal PLOS One.1 Human Participants Showed Heightened Relaxation, ConcentrationLead study author Onyoo Yoo and colleagues recruited a small sample of 30 adults to perform eight different activities with a well-trained dog. The activities included: Meeting the dogGrooming the dogPlaying with the dogTaking photos of the dogFeeding the dogHugging the dogMassaging the dogWalking the dogThe human study participants wore EEG electrodes to record electrical activity in their brain while they interacted with the dog for three uninterrupted minutes. In addition, each participant recorded his or her mood immediately following each activity. The experiments revealed that while participants played with and walked the dog, alpha-band oscillations in the brain increased in strength, suggesting a relaxed and wakeful state. When they were massaging, grooming, or playing with the dog, beta-band oscillation strength increased, which indicates heightened concentration, though without stress. Bottom line, when playing with the dog, both relaxation and concentration were boosted, and the mood assessment revealed significantly lower levels of fatigue, depression, and stress after virtually all the different types of interactions with the dog. As Science Daily explains it: \u201cThe relative strength of alpha-band oscillations in the brain increased while participants played with and walked the dog, reflecting a state of relaxed wakefulness. When grooming, gently massaging, or playing with the dog, relative beta-band oscillation strength increased, a boost typically linked to heightened concentration. Participants also reported feeling significantly less fatigued, depressed, and stressed after all dog-related activities.\u201d2The authors noted that a potential bias in the results could exist based on the fact that a fondness for animals likely motivated the participants to take part in the experiment. However, they believe the unique relationships between specific activities and their physiological effects could benefit future targeted animal-assisted interventions. They feel their study \u201cprovides valuable information for elucidating the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of animal-assisted interventions.\" As licensed clinical psychologist Andrea Bonior Ph.D., who reviewed the study, writes in Psychology Today: \u201cWith not only popular culture embracing time with dogs as potentially playing a role in the fight against ever-increasing stress, anxiety, and depression, but also the medical, psychiatric, and gerontology fields taking dogs seriously for their potential role in well-being, it is imperative that we learn more about what emotional and cognitive effects dogs can have, and why. This research helps start the conversation about what types of activities might be more correlated with what types of brain effects, and it could potentially help target different types of interventions for people suffering from different types of psychological woes.\u201d312 Science-Backed Reasons Pets Make Us Healthier and HappierAccording to Pet Partners, an organization that provided the first comprehensive, standardized training program in animal-assisted activities and therapy for healthcare professionals and volunteers, the following are just a few evidence-based examples of the benefits of the human-animal bond to both pets and people:4 A therapy dog has a positive effect on patients\u2019 pain level and satisfaction with their hospital stay following total joint arthroplasty.Fibromyalgia patients spending time with a therapy dog instead of in an outpatient waiting area at a pain management facility showed significant improvements in pain, mood and other measures of distress.A walking program that matched sedentary adults with therapy animals resulted in an increase in walking over a 52-week graduated intervention with the participants stating their motivation for adherence was \u201cthe dogs need us to walk them.\u201dThe presence of an animal can significantly increase positive social behaviors among\u00a0children with autism spectrum disorder.Children made fewer errors in match-to-sample categorization task in the presence of a dog relative to a stuffed dog or human. Similar studies may indicate presence of a dog serves as both a source of motivation and a highly salient stimulus for children, allowing them to better restrict their attention to the demands of the task.Therapy animals in pediatric cancer studies improved motivation to participate in treatment protocol, to maintain their motivation over time, and to want to \u201cget better\u201d or stay optimistic.Pet ownership, perhaps by providing social support, lowers\u00a0blood pressure\u00a0response to mental stress.Pet owners have higher one-year survival rates following heart attacks.Recognizing and nurturing the connection between animals and humans has potential implications for individual stability and health, improved economic outputs and healthcare cost savings. This conclusion was based on a number of studies.Pet ownership, particularly dog ownership, may be reasonable for\u00a0reduction in cardiovascular disease risk.Pet ownership was associated with a reduced risk for Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and diffuse large cell lymphoma.Human health savings of $3.86 billion over 10 years have been linked to pet ownership as related to a decrease in doctor visits in studies in Austria and Germany.Whether it\u2019s a dog who prompts his human to get outside for daily exercise, a cat who provides cozy company for a shut-in, or a therapy pet who helps her person manage anxiety, animal companions have a tremendous positive effect on human health and happiness. \n            \n                Sources and References\n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            1 Yoo, O. et al.",

He has the same \u201cwith great power comes great responsibility\u201d thing as Spider-man where being a superhero conflicts with his personal life, but while Spider-man keeps trying to balance them, Batman just gives up and just uses Bruce Wayne for philanthropy and as a distractingly shallow cover story. He should never be a jerk just for the sake of it, but he can sometimes prioritize the larger goals of being Batman over everyday human kindness if they come into conflict. He\u2019s very morally absolutist in some respects, like killing, but very pragmatic in other ways, like making contingency plans for his plans.  He lacks humour not because he\u2019s so angsty (although he is angsty) but because every second he spends joking around is a second he could spend saving someone\u2019s life. He\u2019s stoic not because he doesn\u2019t care. but because he simply doesn\u2019t have time to be emotional. He sees so much horror every single day that he doesn\u2019t know how to cope with without repressing it. However, that\u2019s not an excuse. He still needs to remember his humanity. He needs people to remind him of his humanity. That\u2019s what he needs the batfamily for, but the fact that he struggles so hard with this in the first place does huge damage to his relationship to said bat family. This is not just good for his personal life, but also if he completely sacrifices his mental health to be Batman, eventually he\u2019ll be so unstable that it will hurt his ability to be Batman effectively. In the end, repressing emotions will just make them fester.",

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

It was funded by the state\u2019s Homekey Program. \nSteve Bajor, who grew up in Mill Valley, developed the pilot art program to address another important aspect of housing people: quality of life. While there is a fair amount of funding and resources in Marin County for housing, Bajor said community programming within housing sites can be harder to come by. \n\u201cMy premise on this whole thing was we not only need to house people, but we also need to address quality of life,\u201d Bajor said. \u201cThere are a lot of ways to do that, but I figured the place to start was in developing these visual art workshops.\u201d \nBajor received a $2,500 grant from the Mill Valley Rotary Club to start the program.

The instructors leading the classes are retired art teachers in Marin County. \nIdie Weinsoff of Fairfax is teaching the first four classes in the series. Once a week this month, Weinsoff has been teaching participants about drawing, printmaking, watercolor painting and Chinese brush painting. \nShe said the participants\u2019 ability is mixed, and some don\u2019t want to follow any plan, but everyone seems engaged.",

Take it from a former HR person\u2026 this goes double right now.  I just spent some time putting in some job applications myself (not for HR, lol) and got about 15 interviews. And idk if it\u2019s because of COVID uncertainty or if places just don\u2019t fucking care anymore because they know people are desperate for work, but the amount of straight up illegal shit\u00a0my interviewers asked me was appalling.  (That\u2019s not even counting the questions that were technically\u00a0legal but clearly fishing for information they\u2019re not legally allowed to ask.) A tame example? Two questions into a phone interview, the guy on the other end of the line asked:\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  I said\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d - giving him a chance to rethink that.  He didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  \u201cSir, you are not allowed to ask me that question.\u201d  \u201cWell, I want to know. I\u2019m asking.\u201d  \u201cAnd you\u2019re legally not allowed to ask me that. I\u2019m not required to tell you my age.\u201d  At that point, I guess he managed to remember an old HR bulletin or something (I hope to god he wasn\u2019t actually HR himself), and he said,\u00a0\u201cWell, I need to know if you\u2019re over the age of 18.\u201d (Which is what he should have asked in the first place\u2026 or not, since that was in the application that he could have read.)  \u201cYes. I\u2019m over the age of 18.\u201d\u00a0  And we moved on. Two questions later, he tried another illegal question. I called him on it again and ended the interview, citing that a workplace with such a clear disregard for the law, especially upon first contact with a potential employee, was not going to be a good fit. (They offered me the job anyway, lol. I didn\u2019t send a thank-you or a response.) At a different interview, the majority of questions were\u00a0\u201cfishing\u201d questions - just looking for that info they\u2019re not actually allowed to ask. (This person was also either not really HR or an HR person who was exceptionally bad at their job.) I could tell they were getting frustrated when I dodged answering the personal stuff, and they actually got extremely\u00a0upset when I mentioned later in the interview (re: less relevant work experience) I had worked in HR. They were super flustered for the remainder of our time, and I watched them skip over questions on their sheet they had clearly planned on asking. They KNEW they were being sketchy and were counting on me not knowing anything about HR - or my rights - and so they got upset when I did.  These were super tame\u00a0examples. I\u2019m begging you, if you\u2019re job searching right now, PLEASE\u00a0know your rights. Please know what interviewers are allowed to ask.  Please don\u2019t volunteer information or elaborate more than you\u2019re required to about personal things. Save your words (and everyone\u2019s time) by elaborating why you\u2019re good for the position/what you can do.  I may create a resource list on this shit later but PLEASE PLEASE KNOW THIS STUFF BEFORE YOU TALK TO AN EMPLOYER. This goes for anywhere you\u2019re interviewing as well as your current employer. This also goes for HR. HR may be the person you go to when shitty stuff happens, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re your friend (or competent).  They don\u2019t need to know your age (beyond 16+, 18+, or 21+, depending on the job). They don\u2019t need to know your medical history. (For the love of god, do NOT answer the\u00a0\u201chave you been diagnosed with depression?\u201d question.) They don\u2019t need to know if you have kids or whatever. They don\u2019t need to know a LOT of those things that may appear on an application, including your veteran status, whether you\u2019re on/have been on unemployment, etc. They\u2019re not entitled to know specifics about your transportation (unless you\u2019re using that transportation for the job, like Uber/delivery drivers). Look this up for your state/the job\u2019s state.  Beware questions like\u00a0\u201cWhat year did you graduate?\u201d if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t put dates on your resume (I just put amount of time spent at employers, not dates of employment).

Donate to Emergency: Help Evacuate My Family From GAZA WAR, organized by Ahmed Alshawish I\u2019ve witnessed the evidence of the tragedy that has struck our lives in Gaza, where my family and I have survived amidst numerous previous wars.\u00a0But today, we face the most dangerous and fierce battle in the current war. The urgent need intensifies for us, as we have nothing left and are unable to secure our basic needs such as food, water, and safe shelter. Here is our story - On October 7th, our lives changed forever, my family and I evacuated from northern Gaza to southern Gaza, hoping to return soon, but it wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u00a0Our home was surrounded, burned, and then completely destroyed, Our home, once a fortress of hope, now lay in ruins, a stark reminder of our shattered dreams. The night before we left from the north to the south was terrifying. Shelling sounds were everywhere, making a loud noise that felt like it went through our souls. Every\u00a0explosions shook the ground like earthquakes, sending shockwaves of fear through our trembling bodies. filling us with fear. The air smelled of destruction and blood, making it hard to breathe. When dawn came, we saw the devastation around us, realizing our home was now a symbol of loss and despair. We ran into the streets and with each step we took into the unknown streets, we felt as if we were plunging deeper into the abyss of our shattered existence, leaving behind everything we own in our home: Clothes, important official documents, the car, and literally it\u2019s almost everything - the enormity of our loss weighed heavily upon us. Our home it was where we found hope, safety, and made precious memories. Losing it felt like losing years of our lives, leaving us adrift amidst the wreckage of our shattered existence. A brief video depicting the devastation that struck our home and our entire neighborhood in Gaza. Desperate Plea: Escaping Gaza\u2019s Allergy Nightmare I, Haya, suffer from severe allergy to penicillin-derived medications, and my sister, Amal, also suffers from severe allergies to medications from my family such as Paracetamol and Ibuprofen. These allergies create a deep sense of fear and anxiety for us, as we live in a constant state of tension and fear of anything that may require a visit to the hospital.\u00a0We fear being given inappropriate medications due to the unavailability of suitable treatments in Gaza\u00a0because of war or lack of awareness and not informing the doctor of our allergies, which could lead to serious consequences threatening our lives. MY Father Income Our dreams are heading towards oblivion in the labyrinth of an uncertain future My story, along with my siblings, represents a united team of four individuals, three of whom are skilled programmers and one graphic designer. We work as freelancers in the world of freelancing. As for my younger sister, she is a student studying at the College of Architecture. She has always carried a big dream in her heart, a dream of being part of changing Gaza, of making it more beautiful and better.\u00a0She looked forward to the day when she would receive her degree and start building this dream.\u00a0But the beginning of the war changed everything. The destruction of infrastructure and universities cast shadows of despair over her dreams. When I think of my brother in Belgium, I can\u2019t help but feel deep sadness. He has been suffering from unbearable anxiety and insomnia since the outbreak of the war.\u00a0Sleep eludes him at night, and his physical and mental health collapses under the weight of these heavy burdens, negatively affecting his performance at work.\u00a0Problems and challenges pile up in front of him without the slightest opportunity for rest. We all feel psychological pressure and extreme anxiety. The war hasn\u2019t been limited to external attacks but has deeply infiltrated our daily lives.\u00a0We search among the rubble for a little safety and the basic resources for survival. Every day comes with a new challenge that we must overcome. As we sway amidst the rubble of shattered dreams, our souls wrestle and our hearts beat strongly challenging the ravages of war. Our parents earnestly seek a way to rescue us from this hell, feeling the heavy responsibility for every moment we spend under the shadows of fear and destruction. They dream of a safe place where they can build for us a better future, filled with security and hope, for\u00a0we deserve life in all its meanings of comfort and peace. Perhaps this fundraising campaign represents a light in the midst of darkness, it is indeed the only hope we cling to firmly. I appeal to the world as a whole to hear my cry and the mournful cry of my family in Gaza. We need the helping hand that reaches out to wipe our tears and build a bridge to safety. Your donation is not just a donation; it\u2019s an opportunity to rebuild life and brighten a better tomorrow. Be part of our hopeful story, for we need your hand to start anew. The purpose of the fundraising campaign The goal of this fundraising campaign is to rescue my family - my parents, my siblings, and me - through the Rafah Crossing to Egypt, which currently requires $5000 per person. This campaign is our only chance to stay alive, and I humbly request your assistance at this critical time.

        "summary": "Weight loss drugs have drawn investor interest and shaken up other sectors in the past year or so. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly were two early winners of this trend, as their drugs dominate the weight loss drug market. Yuri Khodjamirian, fund manager at Tema ETFs, said both companies are a \u201cvery powerful duopoly.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s obviously going to be room ins such a big market. The estimates currently are about $130 billion from Goldman Sachs. We think it\u2019s going to be multiples of that,\u201d he told CNBC Pro Talks last week. Khodjamirian believes there\u2019s room for at least three players in this space. \u201cI think the market is big enough to sustain three to four players, even at the market caps that are out there right now, but the market\u2019s trying to figure out who that third or fourth player is, and a big breakthrough could be oral GLP-1s,\u201d he said. He was referring to GLP-1, a class of weight loss drugs that was originally developed as a treatment for diabetes. GLP-1 is a hormone released in the gut that stimulates insulin secretion, slows the emptying of the stomach and communicates to the brain a feeling of satisfaction. Stocks to watch Khodjamirian named Amgen , which is developing an injectable drug and other products for obesity. He also pointed out some biotech names with potential but that investors have to be careful about. One of them is Carmot , which was acquired by pharmaceutical firm Roche last year, he noted. He also named smaller biotech firms such as Zealand Pharma and Viking Therapeutics . \u201cThese companies are early biotechs that are developing data. They\u2019re a lot more risky than the bigger ones who already have drugs on the market,\u201d Khodjamirian said. \u201cAnd therefore, you have to just be very careful with making investments in such companies. So a diversified portfolio is probably the best way to go,\u201d he said. Tema ETFs offers actively managed exchange-traded funds, with a focus on health care and life sciences. Khodjamirian is also the chief investment officer of Tema ETFs and manages its Monopolies & Oligopolies ETF , which looks to provide investors with long-term growth through companies that operate in monopolistic industry structures. Khodjamirian highlighted three ETFs his firm manages that are in the health-care industry: the Tema GLP-1, Obesity & Cardiometabolic ETF; the Tema Oncology ETF; and the Tema Neuroscience and Mental Health ETF. He said there\u2019s a \u201cvaluation opportunity\u201d in biotech stocks at the moment, but warned of risks. \u201cSmaller companies in the biotech space are difficult to pick. You have to really know what you\u2019re doing, and \u2026 in most of our biotech portfolios, we have 50 stocks, we don\u2019t own more than 1%, 2% in some of these companies because of these risks, they could go to zero,\u201d he said. However, there are \u201ca lot\u201d of innovations happening in biotech, and \u201cloads of them\u201d are trading below the value of the cash on their balance sheets, Khodjamirian said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a valuation opportunity out there,\u201d he said. \n\n\n \n Source link",

He has the same \u201cwith great power comes great responsibility\u201d thing as Spider-man where being a superhero conflicts with his personal life, but while Spider-man keeps trying to balance them, Batman just gives up and just uses Bruce Wayne for philanthropy and as a distractingly shallow cover story. He should never be a jerk just for the sake of it, but he can sometimes prioritize the larger goals of being Batman over everyday human kindness if they come into conflict. He\u2019s very morally absolutist in some respects, like killing, but very pragmatic in other ways, like making contingency plans for his plans.  He lacks humour not because he\u2019s so angsty (although he is angsty) but because every second he spends joking around is a second he could spend saving someone\u2019s life. He\u2019s stoic not because he doesn\u2019t care. but because he simply doesn\u2019t have time to be emotional. He sees so much horror every single day that he doesn\u2019t know how to cope with without repressing it. However, that\u2019s not an excuse. He still needs to remember his humanity. He needs people to remind him of his humanity. That\u2019s what he needs the batfamily for, but the fact that he struggles so hard with this in the first place does huge damage to his relationship to said bat family. This is not just good for his personal life, but also if he completely sacrifices his mental health to be Batman, eventually he\u2019ll be so unstable that it will hurt his ability to be Batman effectively. In the end, repressing emotions will just make them fester.",

        "url": "https://www.pickleforpay.com/blog/the-legal-and-community-issues-of-noise-pollution-from-pickleball-courts",
        "summary": "As pickleball continues to soar in popularity, communities are increasingly grappling with a surprising consequence: noise pollution. The distinctive sounds of paddles striking balls, coupled with the energetic chatter of players, have sparked complaints and legal battles in neighborhoods across the country. This blog delves into the legal issues surrounding noise pollution from pickleball courts, the impact on communities, real-life disputes, and potential solutions to address these concerns. Understanding the Noise ProblemPickleball, with its unique equipment and lively gameplay, generates noise that can be disruptive, especially in quiet residential areas. The primary sources of noise include: Paddle-Ball Impact: The sound of paddles hitting the ball is notably louder compared to other racquet sports. Player Communication: Players often engage in vocal communication, which adds to the overall noise level. Crowd Noise: Tournaments and social games can draw crowds, amplifying the noise further. Real-Life Disputes: Stories from the CourtsSeveral communities have faced significant disputes due to pickleball noise. Here are some notable stories: Oceanside, CaliforniaIn Oceanside, California, residents living near Melba Bishop Park filed complaints about the constant noise from the park\u2019s pickleball courts. The noise, starting early in the morning and continuing into the evening, disrupted the tranquility of the neighborhood. In response to the complaints, the city council held meetings to address the issue, eventually deciding to reduce the hours of operation for the courts and install sound barriers to mitigate the noise. Despite these measures, some residents felt the actions were insufficient and continued to push for more stringent noise controls. Naples, FloridaNaples, Florida, known for its vibrant pickleball community, became a hotspot for noise disputes. The Pickleball Capital of the World saw tensions rise between avid players and residents of the Naples Bath and Tennis Club. Noise from the nearby East Naples Community Park, which hosted numerous tournaments, led to a lawsuit filed by the residents against the county. The suit claimed that the noise violated local ordinances and significantly impacted their quality of life. The county responded by adding acoustic fencing and relocating some courts, but the legal battle highlighted the complexities of balancing recreational facilities and residential peace. San Diego, CaliforniaIn San Diego, the battle over pickleball noise at Cadman Park became so intense that it led to the temporary closure of the courts. Nearby residents complained about the constant noise, leading to a series of heated community meetings. The city attempted to mediate by introducing restricted hours and quieter equipment, but the conflict persisted. Ultimately, the city decided to move the courts to a less residential area, a decision that satisfied some but disappointed many players who valued the original location for its convenience and community spirit. Legal Issues and Community ComplaintsAs the sport grows, so do the legal challenges related to noise complaints. Residents living near pickleball courts have raised several legal and community concerns: Nuisance LawsuitsResidents disturbed by pickleball noise have filed nuisance lawsuits against local governments, homeowner associations, and private clubs. These lawsuits claim that the noise disrupts their right to quiet enjoyment of their property. Key points in such cases include: Noise Levels: Plaintiffs often argue that the noise exceeds acceptable levels, especially during early mornings or late evenings. Zoning Violations: Some lawsuits contend that pickleball courts violate local zoning laws, which typically regulate noise levels and recreational use in residential areas. Noise OrdinancesMany municipalities have specific noise ordinances designed to regulate sound levels. Enforcement of these ordinances varies, but common measures include: Decibel Limits: Setting maximum allowable noise levels, often measured in decibels (dB). Time Restrictions: Limiting the hours during which noise can be generated, typically prohibiting early morning or late-night play. Community MediationIn some cases, disputes are resolved through community mediation rather than litigation. Mediation offers a platform for residents, pickleball enthusiasts, and local officials to discuss concerns and seek mutually agreeable solutions. Impact on CommunitiesThe noise pollution issue has far-reaching implications for communities: Quality of LifeFor residents living near pickleball courts, persistent noise can significantly affect their quality of life. Common complaints include: Sleep Disruption: Noise during early morning or late-night hours can disrupt sleep patterns. Stress and Anxiety: Continuous noise can contribute to stress and anxiety, impacting mental health. Property Values: Some residents fear that increased noise levels could negatively affect property values. Community RelationsNoise complaints can strain community relations, pitting pickleball players against non-playing residents. This division can create tension and conflict within neighborhoods. Economic ImpactOn the flip side, pickleball courts can boost local economies by attracting players and spectators who spend money on local businesses. Balancing this economic benefit with residents' concerns is a challenging but necessary task. Potential SolutionsAddressing the noise pollution problem requires a multifaceted approach involving technology, community engagement, and regulatory measures. Here are some potential solutions: Acoustic Barriers and FencingInstalling acoustic barriers or specialized fencing can help reduce the noise emanating from pickleball courts. These barriers can absorb or deflect sound, minimizing its impact on nearby residences. Court Relocation and SchedulingStrategically locating pickleball courts away from residential areas can significantly reduce noise complaints. Additionally, implementing specific play hours that avoid early mornings and late evenings can help mitigate disturbances. Equipment ModificationsEncouraging the use of quieter paddles and balls can make a substantial difference. Manufacturers are developing equipment designed to produce less noise without compromising gameplay quality. Community DialogueFostering open communication between pickleball players and residents is crucial. Regular community meetings can provide a forum for discussing concerns, exploring solutions, and building understanding and cooperation. Regulatory MeasuresMunicipalities can revise and enforce noise ordinances to address pickleball-related noise specifically. This might include: Decibel Monitoring: Regularly monitoring noise levels to ensure compliance with set limits. Permit Systems: Implementing permit systems for new courts, requiring adherence to noise mitigation strategies. ConclusionThe rise of pickleball has brought with it a unique set of challenges related to noise pollution. Legal battles and community complaints underscore the need for balanced solutions that respect the rights and enjoyment of all residents. By exploring technological innovations, regulatory measures, and fostering open community dialogue, it is possible to create a harmonious environment where pickleball can continue to thrive without disrupting the peace of our neighborhoods.",

Beyond quarterback Shedeur Sanders and receiver Travis Hunter, no player might end up being more important to CU\u2019s offensive success than Hayden. \nHe profiles as a bellcow running back, the type of downhill runner who puts his foot in the ground, cuts with precision and inflicts punishment on defenders. \nHe transferred from Ohio State in April after turning heads in two years with the Buckeyes. Hayden arrived with no guarantees, just a chance to prove himself. \n\u201cI am really looking forward to this,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cCompetition brings out the best in everyone.\u201d \nHayden found Boulder as much as the Buffs landed him. He wasn\u2019t looking to leave Ohio State, but circumstances changed. He entered his third year in a crowded backfield featuring Heisman candidate TreVeyon Henderson and transfer Quinshon Judkins. After rushing for 553 yards on 111 carries as a freshman, Hayden played in only three games last season, leaving him with three more years of eligibility. \nA fresh start at CU made sense. The gravitational pull of Coach Prime didn\u2019t hurt. \n\u201cI enjoyed my time at Ohio State. It was about doing what was best for my future. Coach Prime is building a great program. I know he gets a lot of hate that he really doesn\u2019t deserve because he\u2019s done a great job here. And everywhere he has been, they have won,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cThe offense, the offensive line they put together, I felt like, \u2018Why not come to CU?\u2019\u201d \nSanders and Hunter enter the season as two of the sport\u2019s most highly regarded players. However, for the Buffs to post a winning record, reach a bowl game and become a Big 12 contender, something has to change. They don\u2019t have to run more than Ralphie, but they must establish a legitimate ground game. \nLast season Dylan Edwards, who departed for Kansas State, led the team in rushing with 321 yards. No running back scored more than three touchdowns. Hayden posted five in his first year with Ohio State.",

Gyan Yog Breath explains how their comprehensive Yoga Teacher Training programs can provide an effective solution for those looking to improve their flexibility. \nHow Flexibility Works on The Endocrine System \nIncorporating flexibility training into your routine has profound effects on the endocrine system, which regulates hormones and impacts overall health. When engaging in regular yoga practice that emphasizes flexibility, the body releases stress-reducing hormones such as endorphins and oxytocin. This helps in lowering cortisol levels, which are often elevated due to stress. Additionally, improved flexibility enhances blood circulation and helps in the effective distribution of hormones throughout the body. This balanced hormonal environment contributes to better mood regulation, reduced anxiety, and overall enhanced physical and mental health. The benefits of flexibility training extend beyond just physical improvements, offering significant positive effects on the endocrine system. \nFlexibility is a valuable asset that contributes to physical health and mental well-being. While many individuals strive for greater flexibility, achieving it can be challenging without the right structure and support. Gyan Yog Breath\u2019s Yoga Teacher Training programs in India offer an effective solution for those looking to improve their flexibility. Through daily practice, expert guidance, and a structured approach, participants can make significant progress in their flexibility journey. \nThe Benefits of Flexibility \nFlexibility is essential for overall health. Increased flexibility can lead to better posture, reduced muscle stiffness, and improved mobility. It also contributes to mental clarity and stress relief. By integrating flexibility into your routine, you can experience enhanced physical performance and greater emotional stability. This is why many people seek to enhance their flexibility, yet achieving significant progress can be challenging without proper guidance and consistent practice. \nThe Challenge of Achieving Flexibility \nAchieving flexibility requires more than just occasional practice; it demands dedication and a structured approach. Many people find it difficult to maintain a regular practice on their own. This is where a structured Yoga Teacher Training program, such as those offered by Gyan Yog Breath, becomes invaluable. These programs provide the daily practice and consistency needed to make real progress in flexibility. \nYoga Teacher Training Programs: The Key to Flexibility \nGyan Yog Breath offers a range of Yoga Teacher Training programs in India that are designed to help individuals improve their flexibility while also preparing them to teach others.",

        "summary": "Peter Dunne writes \u2013\u00a0\n\n\nThe 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted in 1967, regarding sudden vacancies in the office of President and Vice President also includes a complex procedure whereby the President can be removed from office in the event of incapacity, infirmity or other impairment rendering them incapable of carrying out their\u00a0duties. \nIt has been used six times since, twice to fill a vacancy in the office of Vice President, and four times at the behest of Presidents undergoing a short-term medical incapacitation and standing aside temporarily in favour of the Vice President, or, in the case of President Reagan, recovering from an assassination attempt. \nThere are unconfirmed reports that senior figures in the Democratic Party were considering last week whether the 25th Amendment could be invoked to remove President Biden from office, on the grounds of incapacity, if he did not decide to stand down as a candidate for re-election. \nNo similar provisions exist in New Zealand. Both the law and the Cabinet Manual are silent on how to deal with the situation of a Prime Minister who, for whatever reason, becomes incapable of performing their duties, and who will not stand aside. The underlying assumption is that in such situations, which are extremely rare, common sense and good judgement will prevail and that the person will come to the \u201cright\u201d decision and stand down. \nHowever, there have been situations that have tested that touching assessment to its limits. \nWhen Sir Joseph Ward returned for his second stint as Prime Minister in 1928, he was already a frail and sick man.\u00a0\u00a0(During that year\u2019s election campaign, he had famously promised to borrow \u00a370,000,000 \u2013 about $4.3 billion in today\u2019s values \u2013 over one year to boost the economy, instead of \u00a37,000,000 over ten years as his notes had suggested.) By the end of 1929 he was too unwell to attend Parliament on a regular basis, and from early 1930 to even attend Cabinet meetings. He retreated to the Blue Baths health spa in Rotorua, determined to continue as Prime Minister, even though he had long lost the capability to do so. Eventually, he was persuaded by his colleagues to stand down, which he did so reluctantly at the end of May 1930, dying just a few weeks later. \nDuring 1939, Prime Minister Savage became significantly unwell with cancer. By the end of the year, as Savage deteriorated, the effective running of the government was in the hands of Deputy Prime Minister Peter Fraser and the Minister of Finance, Walter Nash. At the same time, the government chose to actively conceal the Prime Minister\u2019s deteriorating health from the public.",

        "summary": "\u00a0  \u00a0Heather Locklear was one of the most recognized and in-demand actors in the 1990s, but her star power began to erode in later years. Is this because of poor career decisions she made or because of personal difficulties? The \u201cMoney Talks\u201d actress has had numerous issues over the years, some of which landed her in rehab multiple times. She\u2019s also had her share of heartbreak, romantic trouble, and run-ins with the law. \u201cShe has so much talent and beauty, and we would hate to see that wasted,\u201d a source close to Locklear told Page Six in 2018. \u201cBut she\u2019s up against a lot of demons. She has no choice except to return to treatment and try again.\u201d Locklear\u2019s life has been full of ups and downs, with devastating times as fans saw their favorite star fall from grace. She may have needed to reach rock bottom before she could bounce back, but the actress\u2019s life appears to be turning around\u2026 Heather Locklear\u2019s substance misuse problems have been well publicized, and she has been said to have sought treatment several times. In 2019, she was admitted to a treatment facility for the second time, and a source told People magazine that those who cared for Locklear were optimistic about her future. \u201cEveryone is hoping that this time will be different, but it\u2019s difficult to predict,\u201d the person said. \u201cThe problem is that she\u2019s not doing anything new; she\u2019s just doing something she\u2019s done before. She\u2019s been to rehab at least 20 times, possibly 25.\u201d The source also mentioned how expensive these programs were and how treatment frequently entailed detoxes. What were Locklear\u2019s specific issues? According to a source, she was seeking treatment for difficulties involving \u201calcohol, pills, and her mental health,\u201d and \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want anybody to hold her accountable.\u201d If you or someone you love is struggling with addiction, treatment is available. Contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357). The disadvantage of living in the public eye is that whatever difficulties or transgressions you have become tabloid fodder. Every blunder an actor makes is extensively documented, and every obstacle they confront becomes a sensational headline. Heather Locklear, whose personal difficulties with substance addiction and mental health issues have become widely publicized, was no exception. Instead of being able to deal with these difficulties discretely, Locklear\u2019s admission to an Arizona rehab facility in 2008 was widely publicized. Her representative told E! News then, \u201cThere is no statement, and we will not comment about Heather\u2019s location.\u201d While she was given some solitude, the publication states that her stay lasted nearly four weeks. Locklear was said to have checked into the Sierra Tucson treatment facility to focus on her mental health. \u201cHeather has been dealing with anxiety and depression,\u201d a spokesperson for the actress said at the time. \u201cShe requested a thorough medication review and entered a medical facility for proper diagnosis and treatment.\u201d Heather Locklear is blessed to have many individuals that care for her and want to see her well. But her recovery is solely her responsibility, and the desire to seek help had to come from her. She made news again in 2018, this time not only for her battles with addiction and mental health issues but also for allegedly refusing help from her friends and family. The news was heartbreaking, and her family\u2019s agony was palpable. \u201cHeather is not receiving the necessary medical and mental health care. It\u2019s not just about getting rehab for addiction issues. Still, also about getting a proper evaluation and treatment for the underlying mental health issues,\u201d a person close to her told People. \u201cShe isolates herself, which exacerbates the other issues. Of course, you can\u2019t force someone to get care; they must want to, but it\u2019s difficult for someone sick to make wise decisions and persevere. She has family and friends that are desperate to assist.\u201d The bright side of this predicament is that Locklear eventually got her help and celebrated her first year of recovery in 2020. She took to Instagram to express herself (or, more accurately, she uploaded a quote attributed to Maya Angelou). \u201cHugs will come later!\u201d she wrote in the post. \u201cToday marks one year of sobriety!!!\u201d Heather Locklear has been unable to escape public interest in her private life, and fans have kept tabs on her over the years. This includes the challenges she faced when trying to deal with her addiction. Luckily, she had constant support from family and friends who wanted to see her get better. At the time, this was not something Locklear wanted to share with the world (which was her decision), and although she would later celebrate her sobriety publicly, in general, she has been much quieter about the journey it took to get there. There was nothing to suggest Denise Richards and Heather Locklear were best friends, but they did appear to be on good terms. They were also neighbors. The friendship part of their relationship would change very quickly after Richards began dating Locklear\u2019s ex-husband, Richie Sambora. But how did Richards and Locklear know each other? Their connection was initially through Charlie Sheen, a friend and former co-star of Locklear\u2019s \u2014 the pair worked together on the series \u201cSpin City.\u201d The relationship between Richards and Sambora isn\u2019t believed to have begun until after Sambora\u2019s divorce. (At the time, Richards and Sheen were also breaking up.) Still, the news must have been a sting to Locklear. \u201cUnfortunately, our friendship had to end, and I\u2019m sad about that. The last thing I want to do is create a media frenzy like this, especially as I\u2019m trying to get through a divorce,\u201d Richards told People in 2006. \u201cWe [Richards and Sambora] were friends, and we were both going through divorces, and that\u2019s what drew us to each other\u2026 I did not steal someone\u2019s husband,\u201d she told Us Weekly. \u201cDid I date a former friend\u2019s ex-husband? Yes. Did I break up a marriage? No. If I were still friends with Locklear, that never would have happened with Richie. There was no friendship anymore before Richie, and I got together.\u201d Her career has slowed down, but she\u2019s kept fighting for a comeback. Heather Locklear was a prominent figure in the 1980s and 1990s, probably most famously for her role as Amanda Woodward on the television show \u201cMelrose Place.\u201d While she continued to land roles after the program ended, there has been a distinct drop in the number of leading roles she landed in subsequent years. Hollywood is seldom kind to elderly actors, but Locklear had to deal with her problems. Was she willing to give up her job for good? Nope. Locklear was thrilled to be cast in the TV film \u201cDon\u2019t Sweat the Small Stuff: The Kristine Carlson Story\u201d in 2021. Many saw this part as her comeback and expected great things from her \u2014 another landmark achievement, besides being sober for almost two years. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved getting older because it means I\u2019m alive,\u201d she said about her upcoming 60th birthday in 2021. \u201cI\u2019m overjoyed. I couldn\u2019t give a damn. I don\u2019t give a damn about my appearance. My parents still care about me. My child loves me.\u201d",

It used to be \u2018I read something i shouldn\u2019t have\u2019 Now its \u2018you wrote something you shouldn\u2019t have\u2019 Side-swipe but bear with me\u2013 Triggering. You keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means. A concept can scare you, offend you, horrify you, disgust you \u2026 and not trigger you.  A psychological trigger is stimuli that causes an overwhelming physical/emotional reaction (for me, it\u2019s people screaming at their kids\u2013 instant panic attack).  When it\u2019s bad, it can kick off deep depressions, panic attacks, self-harm episodes. As adults, it\u2019s our responsibility to know where our triggers are, avoid them where possible, and know how to deal when they happen.  Artists cannot account for every single possible trigger in every single person in the world \u2026 and they shouldn\u2019t have to.  Take responsibility for your own well-being, and accept that consumption of art is done at one\u2019s own risk. \n\nYou keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. Beep boop! I look for accidental haiku posts. Sometimes I mess up. \n\n\nAlso not for nothing but\u2026 there\u2019s a comment section that\u2019s open in most AO3 fics. If you are truly concerned a fic may contain one of your specific squicks or triggers that you absolutely cannot read about, you can try asking before reading. If you ask \u201chey does this contain X?\u201d and the author is still around, they\u2019ll probably answer to the best of their ability. I know I would, and have done in the past. I\u2019ll spoil anything someone wants, if they ask me. My fics don\u2019t have a \u201cdoes the dog die\u201d page but I\u2019m happy to answer if the metaphorical dog does or does not die if asked. Maybe some authors won\u2019t respond, or won\u2019t tell, but then just don\u2019t read that fic (which you wouldn\u2019t be doing anyway if you didn\u2019t ask\u2026 right?). Authors may not be able to account for every squick or trigger out there up front - and again, it\u2019s not their responsibility to do that anyway when it comes to their leisure time activity - but fandom IS a community and I think most fanfic authors won\u2019t have a problem helping another member of their fandom stay safe if directly and politely asked for help.",

Donate to Emergency: Help Evacuate My Family From GAZA WAR, organized by Ahmed Alshawish I\u2019ve witnessed the evidence of the tragedy that has struck our lives in Gaza, where my family and I have survived amidst numerous previous wars.\u00a0But today, we face the most dangerous and fierce battle in the current war. The urgent need intensifies for us, as we have nothing left and are unable to secure our basic needs such as food, water, and safe shelter. Here is our story - On October 7th, our lives changed forever, my family and I evacuated from northern Gaza to southern Gaza, hoping to return soon, but it wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u00a0Our home was surrounded, burned, and then completely destroyed, Our home, once a fortress of hope, now lay in ruins, a stark reminder of our shattered dreams. The night before we left from the north to the south was terrifying. Shelling sounds were everywhere, making a loud noise that felt like it went through our souls. Every\u00a0explosions shook the ground like earthquakes, sending shockwaves of fear through our trembling bodies. filling us with fear. The air smelled of destruction and blood, making it hard to breathe. When dawn came, we saw the devastation around us, realizing our home was now a symbol of loss and despair. We ran into the streets and with each step we took into the unknown streets, we felt as if we were plunging deeper into the abyss of our shattered existence, leaving behind everything we own in our home: Clothes, important official documents, the car, and literally it\u2019s almost everything - the enormity of our loss weighed heavily upon us. Our home it was where we found hope, safety, and made precious memories. Losing it felt like losing years of our lives, leaving us adrift amidst the wreckage of our shattered existence. A brief video depicting the devastation that struck our home and our entire neighborhood in Gaza. Desperate Plea: Escaping Gaza\u2019s Allergy Nightmare I, Haya, suffer from severe allergy to penicillin-derived medications, and my sister, Amal, also suffers from severe allergies to medications from my family such as Paracetamol and Ibuprofen. These allergies create a deep sense of fear and anxiety for us, as we live in a constant state of tension and fear of anything that may require a visit to the hospital.\u00a0We fear being given inappropriate medications due to the unavailability of suitable treatments in Gaza\u00a0because of war or lack of awareness and not informing the doctor of our allergies, which could lead to serious consequences threatening our lives. MY Father Income Our dreams are heading towards oblivion in the labyrinth of an uncertain future My story, along with my siblings, represents a united team of four individuals, three of whom are skilled programmers and one graphic designer. We work as freelancers in the world of freelancing. As for my younger sister, she is a student studying at the College of Architecture. She has always carried a big dream in her heart, a dream of being part of changing Gaza, of making it more beautiful and better.\u00a0She looked forward to the day when she would receive her degree and start building this dream.\u00a0But the beginning of the war changed everything. The destruction of infrastructure and universities cast shadows of despair over her dreams. When I think of my brother in Belgium, I can\u2019t help but feel deep sadness. He has been suffering from unbearable anxiety and insomnia since the outbreak of the war.\u00a0Sleep eludes him at night, and his physical and mental health collapses under the weight of these heavy burdens, negatively affecting his performance at work.\u00a0Problems and challenges pile up in front of him without the slightest opportunity for rest. We all feel psychological pressure and extreme anxiety. The war hasn\u2019t been limited to external attacks but has deeply infiltrated our daily lives.\u00a0We search among the rubble for a little safety and the basic resources for survival. Every day comes with a new challenge that we must overcome. As we sway amidst the rubble of shattered dreams, our souls wrestle and our hearts beat strongly challenging the ravages of war. Our parents earnestly seek a way to rescue us from this hell, feeling the heavy responsibility for every moment we spend under the shadows of fear and destruction. They dream of a safe place where they can build for us a better future, filled with security and hope, for\u00a0we deserve life in all its meanings of comfort and peace. Perhaps this fundraising campaign represents a light in the midst of darkness, it is indeed the only hope we cling to firmly. I appeal to the world as a whole to hear my cry and the mournful cry of my family in Gaza. We need the helping hand that reaches out to wipe our tears and build a bridge to safety. Your donation is not just a donation; it\u2019s an opportunity to rebuild life and brighten a better tomorrow. Be part of our hopeful story, for we need your hand to start anew. The purpose of the fundraising campaign The goal of this fundraising campaign is to rescue my family - my parents, my siblings, and me - through the Rafah Crossing to Egypt, which currently requires $5000 per person. This campaign is our only chance to stay alive, and I humbly request your assistance at this critical time.

There have been many updates to the situation that happened with Vellmori. Tsunul made a good video laying out what happened so I recommend watching that. If people are still using outdated information that Vellmori was fired and that it for her views, they are not trustworthy sources of accurate information on this situation either, regardless of how things turn out with this one. If you want information on the situation itself, wait and encourage others to do the same. Do not jump to conclusions and please discourage others from doing so with the current lack of reliable information.With that, take a sip of water, make some tea, have some biscuits, take a stroll outside if you can. Things will turn out alright and there is nothing to panic about. This stuff is stressful and please prioritise your own mental health and wellbeing \u2764\ufe0f",

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

And idk if it\u2019s because of COVID uncertainty or if places just don\u2019t fucking care anymore because they know people are desperate for work, but the amount of straight up illegal shit\u00a0my interviewers asked me was appalling.  (That\u2019s not even counting the questions that were technically\u00a0legal but clearly fishing for information they\u2019re not legally allowed to ask.) A tame example? Two questions into a phone interview, the guy on the other end of the line asked:\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  I said\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d - giving him a chance to rethink that.  He didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cHow old are you?\u201d  \u201cSir, you are not allowed to ask me that question.\u201d  \u201cWell, I want to know. I\u2019m asking.\u201d  \u201cAnd you\u2019re legally not allowed to ask me that. I\u2019m not required to tell you my age.\u201d  At that point, I guess he managed to remember an old HR bulletin or something (I hope to god he wasn\u2019t actually HR himself), and he said,\u00a0\u201cWell, I need to know if you\u2019re over the age of 18.\u201d (Which is what he should have asked in the first place\u2026 or not, since that was in the application that he could have read.)  \u201cYes. I\u2019m over the age of 18.\u201d\u00a0  And we moved on. Two questions later, he tried another illegal question. I called him on it again and ended the interview, citing that a workplace with such a clear disregard for the law, especially upon first contact with a potential employee, was not going to be a good fit. (They offered me the job anyway, lol. I didn\u2019t send a thank-you or a response.) At a different interview, the majority of questions were\u00a0\u201cfishing\u201d questions - just looking for that info they\u2019re not actually allowed to ask. (This person was also either not really HR or an HR person who was exceptionally bad at their job.) I could tell they were getting frustrated when I dodged answering the personal stuff, and they actually got extremely\u00a0upset when I mentioned later in the interview (re: less relevant work experience) I had worked in HR. They were super flustered for the remainder of our time, and I watched them skip over questions on their sheet they had clearly planned on asking. They KNEW they were being sketchy and were counting on me not knowing anything about HR - or my rights - and so they got upset when I did.  These were super tame\u00a0examples. I\u2019m begging you, if you\u2019re job searching right now, PLEASE\u00a0know your rights. Please know what interviewers are allowed to ask.  Please don\u2019t volunteer information or elaborate more than you\u2019re required to about personal things. Save your words (and everyone\u2019s time) by elaborating why you\u2019re good for the position/what you can do.  I may create a resource list on this shit later but PLEASE PLEASE KNOW THIS STUFF BEFORE YOU TALK TO AN EMPLOYER. This goes for anywhere you\u2019re interviewing as well as your current employer. This also goes for HR. HR may be the person you go to when shitty stuff happens, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re your friend (or competent).  They don\u2019t need to know your age (beyond 16+, 18+, or 21+, depending on the job). They don\u2019t need to know your medical history. (For the love of god, do NOT answer the\u00a0\u201chave you been diagnosed with depression?\u201d question.) They don\u2019t need to know if you have kids or whatever. They don\u2019t need to know a LOT of those things that may appear on an application, including your veteran status, whether you\u2019re on/have been on unemployment, etc. They\u2019re not entitled to know specifics about your transportation (unless you\u2019re using that transportation for the job, like Uber/delivery drivers). Look this up for your state/the job\u2019s state.  Beware questions like\u00a0\u201cWhat year did you graduate?\u201d if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t put dates on your resume (I just put amount of time spent at employers, not dates of employment). They\u2019re fishing for your age. It\u2019s \u201cOh, you know, 100 years ago,\u201d if you feel comfortable making a joke, or\u00a0\u201cAbout [generic number, like 5 or 10] years ago\u201d if not.  Also beware things like the\u00a0\u201cWhat do you do in your free time?\u201d question, even if you already work there. This is not a friendly getting-to-know-you question. This is a basis for judgement. Not up to an invisible standard? They\u2019re going to be biased against you for pay raises, promotions, etc. Mention kids/lots of family/social engagements? That\u2019s a tick against you for not being the kind of person who lives to work (yes, it\u2019s gross and stupid). Mention lots of solitary things? Cool, that\u2019s their mental note to ask more from you because you\u2019re\u00a0\u201cnot doing anything anyway.\u201d By all means, be friendly with your coworkers/talk about shared interests if you want, but it is none\u00a0of your boss\u2019s business, and be aware what could get back to them.\u00a0  Don\u2019t. Tell. Employers. Shit.   \nWe wrote up a handy list of those illegal questions here: 10 Questions You Should Never Be Asked in a Job Interview\u00a0 \n\n\nHopefully people already know this by now, but I saw way too often back when I worked in retail. Don\u2019t add your coworkers or boss on social media. Yes, your coworkers too. You don\u2019t want to accidentally say something to them or have them see a post and mention it to your boss. I\u2019ve seen it happen.\ufffc\ufffc",

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

        "summary": "valentineish: psychoticallytrans: : You might not want to hear this but people with anger issues and/or violent impulses need social accommodations. And no by accommodation I don\u2019t mean walking on eggshells around them, actual accommodations for people with these issues comes down to giving them a space away from what\u2019s triggering them to process their emotions and calm themselves down same as what kind of accommodations people who get sensory overload or just any kind of overwhelmed. There is no moral value to having anger issues or violent impulses, people with them are deserving of accommodation the same as everyone else. I had severe anger issues growing up, and the only way I was ever taught to deal with them was deep breathing. For some reason, deep breathing just triggers me to get angrier. But it\u2019s the only coping skill I ever got taught for it. Here\u2019s a few better ones. Go and exercise. Get all of that energy out and away from the people you love.Get a hang of when you\u2019re winding up to a rage and learn to tell people that you need to step away. I will warn you that the first time that someone refuses to let you go once you learn this skill will spook the hell out of you if you don\u2019t have a backup skill, so figure out ahead of time what you\u2019re gonna do if they won\u2019t let you leave.Learn to set boundaries. One of the best things I ever did for my anger issues was tell people that I can\u2019t deal with people stealing food off my plate. Second best was when I\u2019m mad, telling people not to touch me. I spook easily when I\u2019m already angry.Get a pack of pencils and if nothing is working, break one. Sometimes you really do need to break something in order to feel better, and pencils are cheap. Don\u2019t cook with a knife when you\u2019re mad. If you get too much adrenaline, the knife can slip and hurt you.If you have anger issues that pop up without any seeming reason and frighten you, I would strongly recommend going over the situation and over your mental health. If there\u2019s anything consistent with a mental health condition or with something particular happening to trigger it, seek to eliminate the trigger or treat the issue. Depression, anxiety, trauma, you name it, it can probably present as anger issues under the right circumstances.Some quick notes for people without anger issues that want to help someone who has anger issues: Fear transmutes into anger really, really well if someone\u2019s fear response is \u201cfight\u201d. One of my guesses for why so many men have anger issues is that we\u2019re told we\u2019re not men if we have any other response to fear. However, this issue is far from exclusive to men.Don\u2019t box people in when you\u2019re arguing with them or soothing them. If someone is backed up against a wall and upset, then getting closer to them without permission is a bad call for your safety and for their soothing, because that removes the ability to get away from you. Ask before getting close. This goes double if someone is injured or otherwise vulnerable.Teaching angry people that are distressed about being angry the pencil trick on the spot is really easy and works more often than you can think. Respect people\u2019s requests and boundaries. A lot of people think that some of the boundaries I set up are silly or that once we\u2019re pals, they can ignore them. No, because a lot of my boundaries are related to trauma, and crossing them will trigger me and bring up my anger. All of this goes for children with anger issues as well. I was a child with anger issues, and a lot of disrespect for my boundaries and needs was because my anger was dismissed because I was a child. Respect children\u2019s anger.Walking on eggshells is not and will never be a good way to treat anger issues. Recognizing that people with anger issues deserve to have their boundaries respected and to be treated like human beings is.  An end note: Anger issues are not the same thing as being abusive, because emotions are not abusive. Someone with anger issues can become abusive if they take them out on people, but so can someone with suicidal thoughts who takes them out on people. The issue is targeting another person in order to feel better, not having a mental health issue.  An end note for people with anger issues: It really can get better. You can find coping skills and perhaps meds that help cool you down and settle you. You can find people that will accept that doing that one weird thing spooks the fuck out of you, and will let you leave if you\u2019re scaring yourself. You can gain control of yourself without shutting down emotionally. It\u2019s achievable.  Additionally, anger is neither exempt from nor the sole experience of emotional dysregulation. And a lot of conditions can cause that dysregulation \u2013 PTSD (/ongoing trauma and stress, like mentioned above), dementia, ADHD, even boring old sleep deprivation are just a few examples. The list goes on, because this is an extremely common feature to many neurodivergent experiences. Emotions do not have intrinsic morality, and they are not frivolous set-dressing. Anger is no more inherently toxic than guilt is fundamentally manipulative. These are not behaviors. They are part of your internal experience, and serve as barometers for your mental well-being.  Some people will feel things more intensely or frequently. Punishing them (or yourself) for that is cruel and counterproductive. Have patience, and make the space that\u2019s needed. The world is certainly big enough for accomodations and self-growth.",

This article will explore effective strategies for maintaining mental health and well-being during exam season. \nOverview \nAs a second-year law student, I learned a hard lesson about exam preparation. In the spirit of experimentation, I attempted to pull an all-nighter because everyone else was doing it. The result? I was exhausted, my mind was foggy, and I couldn\u2019t recall most of what I had read.

I start studying weeks or even months before exams, using a plan for spaced repetition. This involves reading a topic today and revising it three days later, then five days after that, and so on. This method helps reinforce my knowledge and reduces the stress from last-minute cramming.",

        "summary": "Sure thing! I don't blame them for turning off reblogs. I had to block some antisemitic creep who reblogged it from me with a rant about how actually it was feminism's fault, so clearly it had broken containment into the gross side of tumblr. Here it is with OP's handle and icon removed so they don't have to be connected to it anymore. It's not just the advertisers- that's definitely also part of it, but this is also the direct, targeted action of a specific christian fundamentalist group, the \"National Center on Sexual Exploitation,\" previously \"Morality in Media\" and \"Operation Yorkville,\" a political lobbying organization that campaigns against pornography, who claim \"Pornographers are committing the biggest crimes of the century!\" ALTIt was*this group specifically* (accompanied by another Christian anti-porn org, Exodus Cry) that put pressure on mastercard and visa to stop facilitating electronic payment for sites that hosted nsfw material. Faced with the risk of losing their ability to process payments, the sites partnered with visa and mastercard had no choice but to agree to porn bans. They were behind Onlyfans flirting with banning sex workers last year, and they were one of the principle supporters of FOSTA/SESTA. I can not understate just how much influence this one well connected, well funded group has. From their about page: ALTNCOSE convinced mastercard and visa to cut ties with porn not for the sake of advertisers, but because they convinced them that they could be potentially liable for facilitating illegal activity- the exchange of CSAM, prostitution and human trafficking- happening on the porn sites they were partnered with, which in NCOSE's opinion is all porn sites, and all porn period, since they believe all porn is human trafficking. ALTALTNCOSE has been around since the 60's, but hasn't seen much success until the last decade. Their previous campaigns, focused on pushing for the enforcement of obscenity laws from the 1800's and fabricating blatantly nonfactual research about porn as a mental health crisis, were not as widely received. But they've had much more success since they've started weaponizing concern for victims of abuse and trafficking, appropriating progressive language and trading in on the white moral panic about child sex trafficking that grew directly from the \"Stranger Danger\" and \"Satanic Ritual Abuse\" moral panics of the 80's and 90's- both themselves the result of a right wing reactionary movement using concern trolling about the safety of children to rail against drugs, loud music, and tabletop rpgs. Blaming the sanitization of the internet solely on the vague specter of \"advertisers\" ignores the real, nameable groups and their extremely straightforward christofacist goals. It promotes apathy, pointing at an ambiguous target that feels as impossible to combat as the machine of capitalism itself. When it's literally just these specific guys, and like two or three similar, equally identifiable organizations! I'm not saying sites like facebook don't have a vested interest in looking squeaky clean and family friendly, but tumblr, pornhub, onlyfans, patreon and gumroad did not move to ban porn because of advertising. Tumblr has never attracted the kind of advertisers who care, and pornhub, onlyfans, patreon and gumroad don't make the bulk of their money from ads, but from user transactions, which MUST be facilitated by an electronic banking platform in order to be safe and reliable. Tumblr's porn ban was due to FOSTA/SESTA meaning the could not continue operating unless they either dumped nsfw content or went adults only and implemented costly and draconian age verification protocols that, frankly, no one was going to put up with for a mediocre blogging platform. The others folded under pressure from the electronic banking platforms, which threatened to drop them as partners due to the pressure *they* were under from NCOSE weaponizing public opinion to create a flurry of anger and condemnation towards these companies \"facilitating human trafficking.\" The enemy is not hiding, we know their names! They come not in the name of capitalism (who merely rides their coattails when convenient) but in the name of puritanical Christian Fascism. So no, it's not the puriteens. It's their parents and grandparents, on an open crusade to enforce Christian anti-sex beliefs on as much of the world as they can manage. neolithicsheep: hareofhrair: hareofhrair: Pedophilia is incredibly uncommon, and the vast majority of people who commit sex crimes against children are opportunists who attack children they already have access to (ie, family members) and who have no previous pedophilic interests. Which is to say, they don\u2019t actually have an established attraction to children, anymore than all rapists have an established interest in noncon. Sexual assault is driven by power, not sexual proclivities. While traditional conservative power structures increase predator\u2019s opportunities to exploit children and get away with it, it does not increase the actual number of predators, or turn them into an organized political group. Convincing you the world is full of pedophiles scheming ways to get access to as many kids as possible is part of the anti sex agenda. It\u2019s the cornerstone of how they push the \u201cwe have to get rid of the pedophiles to Protect the Children narrative,\u201d which is then followed by declaring everyone they disapprove of pedophiles. You\u2019re not letting go of the false narrative by pointing it in the other direction. This is literally how otherwise progressive queer people fall down the sex negativity pipeline. This is how you get the puriteens.  \u201cThe world really is full of pedophiles and deviants, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re actually all people I disagree with.\u201d -> \u201cThis person I disagree with has a fetish that disgusts me so they\u2019re probably into everything disgusting, and pedos are everywhere, so they\u2019re probably a pedo.\u201d -> \u201cWow when did this site get so full of pedos!! Children should really have their own spaces online where they\u2019re completely isolated from adults.\u201d -> \u201cChildren can\u2019t be trusted around any adult they don\u2019t know, that person could be a pedo.\u201d -> \u201cAdults who interact with kids or children\u2019s media are most likely pedos looking for kids to groom.\u201d -> \u201cKids should really never be exposed to anything sexual at all and anyone trying to show a kid something I consider sexual is obviously a groomer.\u201d -> \u201cWow why does it seem like there are more pedos around every day??\u201d -> \u201cThere are more pedos than there used to be, so something must have changed to create more pedos. Probably the internet making access to porn so easy.\u201d -> \u201cPorn can turn normal people into pedos.\u201d -> \u201cPedos are increasing because they\u2019re pornsick, corrupted by normal porn use until now they can\u2019t get off without hurting someone.\u201d -> \u201cPorn turns you into a pedo. We should ban porn.\u201d The Stranger Danger moral panic was a reaction increased racial integration and the sexual revolution. Immigrants are flooding the country. Black people are moving into the suburbs. Gay people are in your neighborhoods, recruiting your kids. Conservatives used this to convince people who were *otherwise not politically aligned with them* that their white discomfort was actually a *natural instinctive reaction* to predators who were a Threat to their Families. So you can\u2019t trust your kids around the neighbors. It\u2019s normal to want to keep them completely under your constant surveillance.  This creates a culture of isolation that prevents people from interacting with their communities, where they might become friends with non white or queer people and be exposed to new perspectives. Which reinforces their discomfort and desire to isolate, and makes them vulnerable to further fear based conservative ideology, such as demonizing urban living and \u201coverpopulation,\u201d from which it\u2019s a short jump to the Great Replacement.  The world is not full of pedophiles. The people in your community are not predators waiting for their chance to hurt you and corrupt your children. Question your desire to ascribe deviant sexuality to people you don\u2019t like.  Added in the sources I couldn\u2019t before. Btw, this is why kink positivity is critical to queer liberation. Until we can shake the urge to demonize people for deviant sexuality, we will only ever be supporting the arguments of the people who believe our identities are sexually deviant. While I\u2019m here- The vast majority of kidnappings are committed by one of the child\u2019s parents. Child abductions by strangers are vanishingly rare. Most minors involved in sex trafficking are homeless teens, disproportionately queer, who fled or were kicked out of unsupportive homes. Homeless minors are then charged with prostitution for seeking help. Those that aren't homeless are probably being trafficked by relatives.Women are far more at risk of sexual assault by family and intimate partners than random strangers. In the vast majority of rapes, the victim knows their attacker.Human traffickers do not stalk random women in parking lots. The most frequent targets of human trafficking are legal foreign nationals- especially those that can't speak english, indigenous women and girls, migrant laborers, and homeless youth.- In other words, people without communities and support systems.Both men and women are targeted, and forced labor is at least as common as sex trafficking, but sex trafficking is more highly reported and forced labor is more difficult to detect and prosecute. The world of sexual menace is a fabrication created to keep you scared and isolated, and only reinforces the patriarchal structures that enable real abuse.Children who don\u2019t trust any adults outside their family and have no exposure to healthy sexuality are more vulnerable to abuse by their family, and less likely to reach out for help. Women who feel all the men outside their immediate circle are predators, who are taught being alone is inherently dangerous and that they are safest with a boyfriend or husband to protect them, are more likely to tolerate abuse and less likely to leave or seek help.  People who are convinced that sexual predators are everywhere, will not question it when whole demographics of people are labeled that by people they trust and consider authorities. Reach out to your neighbors. Be part of your communities instead of just living there. Build support networks to protect you from abuse and exploitation. Encourage sex positive education and the decriminalization of sex work and consensual kink. Always interrogate your disgust. Disgust is not a measure for morality. Reblogging for this specifically. There has been a huge push in the past 20 years for cis women to see all unknown men as dangerous and threatening and to overestimate the rate at which violence from strangers occurs. Cis women are most likely to be assaulted (sexually or otherwise)/murdered BY A MAN WHO IS A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER. The most dangerous thing a cis woman can do is be related to, date, or marry a cis man. That guy on the street cat calling or making gross comments? He will make you uncomfortable or frightened but statistically speaking that's the extent of it. Whereas 34% of cis women murder victims are killed by their spouse or partner (overwhelmingly cis men) and overall 76% of cis women victims are killed by someone they know, with only 12% of victims killed by a stranger. Don't take it from me, take it from the Bureau of Justice Statistics! Numbers wise that works out to about three cis women killed every single day by their spouse or partner, about 3 killed by friends and family, and about 1 by a stranger.  And yet the focus is on how scary it is to be out in public alone, how frightening strange men are, how it is better to be in the woods with a bear, etc etc. This is just 19th Century rhetoric about the dangers outside the home being resurrected for the 21st century with the same aim of limiting women's participation in public life. It's bullshit and I hated it when I was still a woman and it still annoys me now, obviously. When I was coming up in the 80s and 90s the violent crime rate was much higher and we held Take Back The Night marches and went for walks at midnight anyway because the whole world was ours, too, and we were going to act like it. Here we are 30 or 40 years later with LESS crime. SAFER streets! Cell phones in people's pockets! You have never been safer in public in my entire life and yet all the rhetoric is about how dangerous it is for cis women to be seen in public without a man! Fuck that noise. Learn the truth and when someone tries to make you afraid, tell them of course you'll be safe, you're leaving your boyfriend/husband/partner at home. Then go for a walk at midnight and look at the stars. Or the streetlights or whatever it is you can see at night in cities.  Female Murder Victims and Victim-Offender Relationship, 2021",

        "summary": "If you were hoping to get some medications prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) while in college or at university, you might be in for a rude surprise.  \nColleges and university are cutting back on their involvement with ADHD, primarily due to abuse of the psychiatric medications \u2014 stimulants like Ritalin \u2014 prescribed to treat the disorder. Students \u2014 whether they are malingering the symptoms or actually have it \u2014 are prescribed a drug to treat ADHD (sometimes from different providers in different states), then sell a few (or all the) pills on the side. Profit! \nNow universities are becoming wise to the epidemic nature of the problem, as some studies have suggested up to a third of college students are illicitly taking ADHD stimulants. \nThis might help curb the abuse problem, but will it also make it harder for people with actual ADHD to receive treatment? \n \nThe short answer is, yes, of course. Students with a pre-existing diagnosis of attention deficit or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder will still often be able to get their prescriptions filled while at school. The university just doesn\u2019t want to do the diagnosing of ADHD any longer. \nI\u2019ve long wondered at the wisdom of universities getting into the ADHD business in the first place. University counseling centers generally shrug off long-term treatment of serious mental illness. So it\u2019s never been clear to me why they were comfortable prescribing medications for ADHD. \nThe New York Times notes \u2014 in a well-written take on this issue by Alan Schwarz \u2014 that the changes are sweeping campuses throughout the country: \n\nLisa Beach endured two months of testing and paperwork before the student health office at her college approved a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Then, to get a prescription for Vyvanse, a standard treatment for A.D.H.D., she had to sign a formal contract  \u2014  promising to submit to drug testing, to see a mental health professional every month and to not share the pills.",

The horrific story of the recent war in Gaza   Since the beginning of the last war in Gaza, our home has been completely destroyed, forcing us to be displaced.

        "summary": "SOS features may not make for the most exciting tech announcements, but they can save lives. At this year\u2019s WWDC, Apple announced that iOS 18 will be adding live video support for emergency calls, and now the support platforms that power 911 are getting ready to help you talk with operators face-to-face.  \nApple calls this feature Emergency SOS Live Video, and 911 support platforms such as Prepared and RapidSOS Unite have already announced that they\u2019ll be using it once iOS 18 officially launches later this year. Responders will be able to request a live video call with you, and if you approve it, they\u2019ll be able to start a FaceTime-like chat with you. This comes after Apple announced that iOS 18 will allow you to use satellite messaging when you don\u2019t have any cellular service. \nBeyond video, Emergency SOS already supports texts and voice calls and even automatically sends your location to emergency responders as soon as you reach out to them. The live video call feature will help responders identify nearby landmarks and assess the situation better. Here\u2019s what Apple says about this feature: \nEmergency SOS Live Video allows users to share context through streaming video and recorded media. In the middle of an emergency call, participating emergency dispatchers can send a request for a user to share live video or media from the user\u2019s camera roll over a secure connection, making it easier and faster to get help. \nHow to use Emergency SOS on your iPhone\nYou can quickly launch Emergency SOS by following these steps: \nPress and hold the side button and one volume button until you see the Emergency SOS slider.  \nDrag the Emergency SOS slider to the right. This will call emergency services.  \nAlternatively, you can hold the power button and a volume button down and wait for a countdown and alarm to begin. You can release these buttons as soon as the countdown starts. If you haven\u2019t canceled the call by the end of the countdown, your iPhone will call emergency services. \nAlternatively, Emergency SOS access can be configured in your iPhone\u2019s settings. Go to Settings > Emergency SOS to see toggles to call emergency services with five rapid button presses instead, or to silence the alarm. There\u2019s also a toggle to turn keep your iPhone from automatically calling emergency services after detecting a crash, which you should probably leave on but could be helpful you\u2019re about to ride a roller coaster. If your emergency is not life-threatening, you can also use Emergency SOS to reach out to AAA for roadside assistance too.",

For those who are unfamiliar, this is Can\u2019t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The relevant part from the Guggenheim\u2019s description of the piece is: Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are known for using dark humor to address contentious topics, and the robot\u2019s endless, repetitive dance presents an absurd, Sisyphean view of contemporary issues surrounding migration and sovereignty. However, the bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. I love this piece. I was instantly compelled by it, so much so that I wrote about it for an art class. It initially resonated with me on a personal, mental health level - in my case, OCD - as it has for others seeing it on social media. However, it\u2019s absolutely incomplete without the political context. The message about border control is, in my opinion, much more interesting and thought-provoking because it is less obvious. I\u2019m glad that people have that initial mental health connection with the Can\u2019t Help Myself - I think it only adds to the message of criticizing border control that we relate to the robot. It makes us examine how we help enforce surveillance and nationalism in our own lives. But people are being deprived of that deeper message when it\u2019s shared without context.",

        "summary": "\u00a0It did not have to be this way.\u00a0The COVID-19 pandemic cost American citizens their lives, their livelihoods, education, mental health, reputations and, ultimately, civil and religious freedoms. \u201cThe U.S. accounts for less than 5% of the world\u2019s population, but more than 25% of total COVID-19 cases reported across the globe,\u202fand it currently ranks among the top 10 countries in COVID-19-related deaths per capita,\u201d wrote the authors of \u202f2023 commentary\u202fin the Journal of the American Medical Association. And for all that, we have government to thank.\u00a0\u00a0  For years leading up to the pandemic, the nation had spent billions on\u00a0preparation and planning\u00a0for a biohazard attack or event.\u00a0Whatever we learned was\u00a0quickly discarded\u00a0or undone by a lack of accountability, transparency, and humility. Decades of planning and untold man hours of research and training were rendered ineffective by a corrupt culture of greed, self-importance, scientific misconduct, and outright fraud. Because, while the government worked to prevent the worst,\u00a0it was also helping to create chaos and contagion by funding and facilitating gain of function (GOF) research.\u00a0 GOF research refers to laboratory efforts to make viruses deadlier or to increase their transmissibility. The potential for disaster is obvious.\u00a0Almost five years prior to the pandemic Dr. Marc Lipsitch and Dr. Alison Galvani noted that GOF pathogenic research posed \u201ca risk of accidental and deliberate release\u00a0that, if it led to extensive spread of the new agent, could cost many lives \u2026 Furthermore, the likelihood of risk is multiplied as the number of laboratories conducting such research increases around the globe.\u201d\u00a0 But according to Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s emails and other NIAID communications obtained via FOIA \u2013 those that weren\u2019t deleted by the now-infamous \u201cFOIA lady\u201d \u2013\u00a0the Wuhan lab was working on Covid research with the U.S.\u00a0as early as 2015. And the worst happened. Dr. Richard H. Ebright of Rutgers University\u00a0told a Senate committee\u00a0hearing on June 18, 2024, that \u201c\u2026 lapses in U.S. oversight of gain-of-function research and enhanced potential pandemic pathogen research likely contributed to the origin of COVID-19 \u2026\u201d\u00a0 While Ebright said GOF has no medical utility, he emphasized that there are \u201cmajor incentives to researchers worldwide, in China, and in the U.S. The researchers undertake this research because it is easy, they get the money, and they can get the papers [in science journals].\u201d\u00a0 Not surprisingly, China was selected because it was quicker and cheaper to conduct research without U.S. government entanglements or oversight.\u00a0Dr. Steven Quay also testified\u00a0on June 18 and said the Wuhan Institute of Virology is a \u201clevel-2 lab,\u201d as opposed to highly secure level-4 labs elsewhere. Moreover, Dr. Fauci et al were able to fund this research because the law was silent. Ebright again:\u00a0\u00a0 \u2026 in this category of research, which is the most significant in terms of consequences and potentially existential risk there is almost no regulation with force of law. No regulation with force of law for biosafety or any pathogen other than the smallpox virus and no regulation with force of law for bio risk management for any pathogen. But the U.S. and the world, may have temporarily escaped imminent catastrophe. Consider, according to Dr. Quay, what Wuhan obtained from Canada\u2019s National Microbiology Lab in 2019: \u201ctwo vials each of 15 strains of virus: seven varieties of\u00a0Ebola virus, the Hendra virus, and two strains of Nipah virus, Malaysia and Bangladesh.\u201d\u00a0These virus samples, according to Dr. Steven Quay, are \u201cthe top three most deadly human pathogens on the planet.\u201d\u00a0The samples were obtained under murky circumstances (\u201cdescribed as a possible policy breach\u201d) from a level-4 lab and surreptitiously flown on a commercial flight to Beijing where they were subsequently placed in a level-2 lab overseen by a country with a long history of a disregard for proper safety protocols. Gain of function research probably created COVID-19, but our legislative and executive branches created the conditions for the disaster.\u00a0Congress failed to pass laws governing specific GOF research, both Congress and the executive branch failed to effectively manage the federal health and science bureaucracy, and various agencies failed to monitor the behavior and performance of grantees and vendors engaged in GOF research. When catastrophe struck, self-interest and political survival of those responsible overrode the best interests of our citizenry.\u00a0 Who in the government benefited? How and to what extent did they benefit? Did any GOF research contribute to the U.S. global or response?\u00a0Is GOF research being rerouted to our defense and security agencies to avoid scrutiny? NIAID continues to stall, obfuscate, and otherwise restrict transparency to its current and past activities.\u00a0We know there was a concerted effort by senior leaders like Anthony Fauci to hide or delete emails but many other records still likely exist that remain uncovered. This must change.\u00a0Any research activity or sponsorship of scientific endeavors that are capable of mass extinction, such as GOF, must be subjected to a higher level of accountability and scrutiny by our elected leaders and the American public. Accountability, transparency, and public debate after an international crisis like Covid-19 can\u2019t undo the global catastrophic harm that was done. It can, however, reduce the ability of our public health bureaucracy to contribute to the next disaster or looming crisis. Martin Hoyt is the Director for Public Health Reform Alliance, a nonpartisan organization committed to increasing transparency and oversight on the public health system so it works better for all Americans.\u00a0   https://www.zerohedge.com/political/gain-function-loss-pf-everything-else",

        "summary": "A 53-year-old Berthoud man has been sentenced to eight years to life in prison for child sexual assault. \nMichael Dale Paustian pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault of a child from a position of trust for a victim under the age of 15 and sexual exploitation of a child, both class 3 felonies, in mid-May, according to a release from the 8th Judicial District Attorney\u2019s Office. Several other charges, including seven other sexual assault charges, were dismissed in the plea agreement, according to court records. \nThe sentence is considered an indeterminate sentence, meaning he will first become eligible for release to parole at the completion of the eight-year sentence, but can be held in custody for the remainder of his life, according to the release; the Colorado Department of Corrections determines when he will be released. \nFollowing his prison sentence if he is released, Paustian will be required to serve 10 years of sex offender intensive supervised probation. This would include several requirements, including being placed on the sex offender registry for the remainder of his life, being unable to subscribe to any internet service provider or access the internet in any way without approval from his probation officer, being unable to contact any children unless approved, and undergoing both mental health and substance abuse evaluations as well as any recommended treatment. \nIn September of 2022, an adult victim came forward to the Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office to report she had been sexually assaulted repeatedly by Paustian, according to the release; at the time of the assaults, she was 6 years old. Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office arrest records show he was arrested in the 3200 block of West Eisenhower Boulevard in late May of 2023. \nThe DA\u2019s release did not include any further information on the assault in question. \nInvestigators learned throughout the investigation that the victim had disclosed the assaults to several family members and that Paustian had disclosed it as well, but authorities were never notified, according to the release. \n\u201cShe has become the person she needed to protect her when she was six,\u201d said Deputy District Attorney Leeah Lechuga about the victim coming forward. \u201cBut she shouldn\u2019t have to.

        "url": "https://www.thedailydoom.com/p/bidenomics-kicks-in-economy-is-on",
        "summary": "Photo by Andrej Li\u0161akov on UnsplashI\u2019ve had, one might say, a great run for all of my predictions this year. Every step along the way, I was able to show where they came true. The economy slowed to a crawl in the first quarter, inflation returned to rising when few thought it would. Employment numbers put in head-fakes that made employment the unreliable gauge I said it was, and inflation along with a reportedly \u201cstrong and resilient\u201d labor market, kept the Fed from making any rate cuts at all this year as I said would be the case up to this point when nearly everyone else thought otherwise. I held my ground. HOWEVER, if today\u2019s big economic reports are true, all of that just turned on its head and threw me out the window! Unemployment went back to falling just when I said it was finally turning. GDP rose above its decade average! And, most significantly, inflation practically disappeared entirely, coming pretty close to touching the Fed\u2019s 2% target! Of course, if this suddenly thriving economy is really the accurate picture, the Fed is not under the pressure it believed it was to cut rates in September. It could still cut rates because inflation is practically over, but not because of rising unemployment and a softening economy, which were the reasons Powell gave for thinking about a September cut. The Fed clearly believed recession and rising unemployment were a growing concern and had started leaning toward rate cuts this September as a precaution right after all Fed heads had, just a month before, indicated we\u2019d be lucky to get one rate cut at the end of the year (at best), and most had said they didn\u2019t see any rate cut coming until next year. So, this economic news is bouncing the Fed around, too. So, what gives? What we see right now is the Fed\u2019s perfect soft landing scenario, where the inflation fight is nearly over, the economy is \u201cstrong and resilient\u201d still and recession has been avoided entirely as the Fed glides its 747 in for an inflation landing where it will soon be able to cut rates because \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d The truth is, I don\u2019t know! If I\u2019m wrong I\u2019ll say so. That\u2019s why I bring it up as I did in the subhead for this article. For certain I\u2019ll be digging through the numbers tomorrow as I start putting together my Deeper Dive (composed on Fridays now in lieu of headlines and a shorter editorial) because, if this report is true, I should stop writing The Daily Doom and pro-rate a refund of people\u2019s remaining annual subscriptions because suddenly I have gone from being right on just about everything to wrong on everything I thought I was right on! The whole first half of the year was a head fake in terms of where the economy has been headed. At first look, the numbers under the hood of this report look pretty solid, too. In my defenseI will note that I had not really expected inflation to take its next turn back up, after its recent pause, until the end of August/start of September because of the lags in the two main drivers that I said in an earlier Deeper Dive would be pricing through soon. One of those  lagging causes for a rise in reported inflation was housing, which has a well-known lag of a year or longer before actual market price changes show up in the CPI report. Since real-market housing prices have been rising for about year now (quite a lot!), it was time for the lag to end and the upward repricing to start to show near the end of August. The other is oil, which prices through right away under energy, but which also prices into everything else measured in CPI over time because it is used at multiple points in various ways in nearly all manufacturing and services. So, eventually, everyone has to start adjusting their prices higher if oil prices remain up long enough. While I didn\u2019t expect to see much rise in inflation in this report, I certainly did not expect to see it plunge almost out of existence! I didn\u2019t expect to see new unemployment claims fall by 10,000 per week either because it looked like labor really had finally started to put in that turn that I rightly predicted would be VERY long in coming, leaving the Fed no room or legal reason (based on its mandates) to cut interest rates until the turn finally came in; but, at last, I thought the turn was here. Here were the basic numbers that all flipped on me:Real US GDP grew at 2.8% in the second quarter! That\u2019s not a huge number but it is robustly above its longterm average and solidly above economists\u2019 expectations that it would rise from the first quarter\u2019s 1.4% to 2.1%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE) of inflation dropped all the way from 3.4% in the first quarter to 2.6% in today\u2019s report, and core inflation dropped from 3.7% to 2.9%! Under the hood, the main categories looked good. The rise was largely due to consumer spending and businesses building up inventory. Consumer spending rose from 1.5% growth in the first quarter to 2.3%. Those rich consumers are forking it over! Both services and goods saw solid increases in growth, making the mini boom broad-based. In a separate report, initial jobless claims all fell by 10K this week, causing continuing claims to slip back down, too. And the kudos poured in: \u201cThe composition of growth was one of the better mixes that we have observed in some time,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. The report \u201ctends to support the idea that the American economy is in the midst of a productivity boom which over the medium term will lift living standards across the country via lower inflation, low employment and rising real wages\u2026.\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saw the GDP report as \u201caffirming the path we\u2019re on to steady growth and declining inflation,\u201d in remarks she delivered Thursday morning in Rio de Janeiro. Even the Fed\u2019s Dovish Dudley had said just a month ago, \u201cI changed my mind. The  Fed needs to cut rates now [to make sure things don\u2019t get even worse in the labor market].\u201d Well, so much for his need to change his mind or say he was wrong. He would never have said that if he had any idea today\u2019s report would be coming out as rosy as it did. Says the former St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard today, I think we\u2019ve got normalization in the labor market. We\u2019ve got inflation just 50-60 basis points away from target. You\u2019ve got the economy growing at potential. This is a soft landing, and the last piece of a soft landing is to get the policy rate back to normal. So, major score for J. Powell! The only reason to cut rates will be to ease the plane up to the loading ramp. Here are some of the problems with it allI will note this is exactly the kind of everything-is-sunshine report an incumbent administration would long for during the middle of a presidential election year. Makes one wonder \u2026 electioneering? We know that none of the people in the Biden administration would lie about the condition of the economy any more than they would lie about the condition of the president, himself. (Watch the excellent and humorous takedown on that posted by Elon Musk in the humor section for paying subscribers below.) Today\u2019s government reports don\u2019t square with anything else we are seeing. (Maybe I\u2019m just seeing double due to heat stroke.) It doesn\u2019t square with the big drop just reported for manufacturing yesterday. It also rises above the improvement reported for services yesterday. It doesn\u2019t square with the Fed\u2019s reserve-bank reports on industry conditions in their regions that have been recessionary in almost every region for almost every month for more than a year. It certainly doesn\u2019t square with the declining earnings in recent corporate reports that have been peeling layers off the stock-market onion and making investors cry lately. Those earnings have been saying revenue is down and so are profit margins. How do you manage that kind of fail in a strong and rising economy? The idea that the rise in real GDP was driven by a rise in consumer spending is a bit difficult to swallow because the same report shows the personal savings rate is falling while credit-card delinquencies have risen to an all-time high (in data that only goes back to 2012). Revolving debt balances have reached a new high even as banks are reporting they are tightening credit standards and turning down more new credit applications. So, how are consumers doing this? The rise in retail sales seems a bit at odds with the rapid closure of retail locations all over the country, spread among many major retailers as well as with the rise in retail bankruptcies. In particular, sales of durable goods (big-ticket items, ranging from stoves, cars, and refrigerators to airline jumbo jets) tumbled 6.6% in the latest report. Almost all of that, however, was in transportation so probably Boeing\u2019s fault. It wasn\u2019t just planes, though. Automaker stocks, particularly Ford, took a big hit today as they missed low expectations. Doesn\u2019t sound like a strong economy. Stocks overall took a big swing today with the early headline pointing to a 400-point rise in the Dow as it attempted to claw back most of yesterday\u2019s losses, but that all fell apart after today\u2019s reports (in spite of or because of?). In the end, the Dow was up a mere 0.2% (81 points), and the other two major indices went from going up to ending down. I\u2019ll point out the numbers were, as always, adjusted for seasonality and inflation, and that the amount taken out for inflation was far from real \u2026 but, then, it always is. So, comparatively speaking, it was still a report of rising economic strength; but when elections get extremely rough for the incumbent, as they have been, there may be an inclination to adjust the adjustments. I\u2019ll dig through the details and lay out anything questionable if there is anything to report in this week\u2019s Deeper Dive. I\u2019ll also hold off on judging myself until we get to the end of summer because I have indicated the resumption of inflation would take until then and because this could all be a one-off\u2014just one more head fake in a stream of them during the Year of Chaos. So, let\u2019s see where the dust settles. I\u2019ll note there have been many times along the way where I have felt like I stood against the entire media, including many in the alternative press, only to find the predictions I had made coming true, albeit a month or two delayed. So, this is another time where I\u2019ll stand my ground on where I\u2019ve said we\u2019re going, though everything appears to be against me. That is not to be stubborn or to delay accepting the truth but on the basis that the picture presented today looks badly skewed compared to so many things we are seeing in other reports that\u2019s it\u2019s too early to trust today\u2019s reports and to not trust myself. (That, and the entire administration has actually been known to lie just a little about important things like the mental health of the \u201cleader of the free world.\u201d) So, in an election year, I have to cut myself a little slack on the possibility of government-fabricated numbers.

        "summary": "OPINION \nI am infuriated. \nThe feminist Left\u2019s desire for all women to blindly support a presumptive Democratic nominee merely because she could become the first female president undermines educated political decision-making. \nCompetence, integrity, vision, and accountability must be the cornerstones for evaluating any candidate, regardless of gender. Supporting an unqualified female perpetuates harmful stereotypes and impedes the advancement of genuinely deserving women striving for leadership roles. Mark that down, as this campaign unfolds. \nThe Democratic Party has a troubling history of favoring their chosen female candidates. In the 2016 primaries, Bernie Sanders faced considerable obstacles designed to help Hillary Clinton. Leaked emails exposed DNC bias through debate scheduling, fundraising arrangements, and other moves that disadvantaged Sanders, tarnishing the primary process and disenfranchising his supporters. \nNow, with President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race, Vice President Kamala Harris emerges as the likely nominee without the rigor of a competitive primary. This circumvention of democratic norms casts doubts about her mandate and ability to unify the party and govern effectively. \nHer performance as vice president has been embarrassingly inadequate, especially addressing the border crisis. Harris, who was tasked by Biden with managing the migration from Central America, has made little progress or produced any tangible outcomes. Her delayed border visits and sluggish responses have exacerbated the crisis, leading to more violence and jeopardizing American safety and security. \nHer record as California\u2019s attorney general raises even more questions, particularly for the progressive feminist so quick to jump on board. Her office\u2019s aggressive prosecution of marijuana offenses disproportionately affected economically disadvantaged communities, while her push to extend prison sentences raised ethical concerns about exploiting inmates for cheap labor in state correctional facilities. \nA particularly damning instance from Harris\u2019s tenure concerns the mishandling of evidence in the case of George Gage, a death row inmate. Her office failed to disclose critical medical records that exonerated him, demonstrating a disrespect for justice and fairness. This inexcusable lapse underscores serious ethical failings and casts doubts on Harris\u2019s commitment to upholding due process and the rule of law. She\u2019s not who you think she is, so please do your homework. \nThe Democratic Party\u2019s patronizing approach is even more deeply disturbing. By actively interfering to elevate their chosen women, they reinforce a harmful notion that women cannot succeed on their own merits. That\u2019s simply wrong. Worse, their interventionist mindset undercuts the achievements of capable female leaders who earned their positions through hard work and ability, not party favoritism.",

        "url": "https://dwarvendiaries.tumblr.com/post/757019765652979712",
        "summary": "headspace-hotel: Dwarf fortress update:  My population is 300+ now and i\u2019ve been amusing myself with conducting raids on the elves. The loot from the elves is crap, the main purpose of raiding is to steal their animals.  The first couple raids I did yielded several dingoes and a couple of grizzly bears (which apparently can be trained for war). Since then, I\u2019ve gotten large numbers of: weasels, badgers, moose, leopards, jaguars, cougars, wolves, great horned owls, black bears, and armadillos, plus a pair of tigers and one cheetah.  The benefit in having lots of animals is that you can make them adoptable as pets, and dwarves that like a certain species will be very happy to adopt them. One of my miners likes wolves and he has 4 pet wolves now. Dwarves can also have preferences for a certain species as food or the skins and bone thereof as a crafting material.  I finally broke and made dungeons and appointed a dungeon master, but as it turns out incarceration in dwarf fortress has about the same benefit to public health and welfare that it does in real life. I was able to convict and imprison the dwarves that keep throwing tantrums and killing other dwarves, but while caged their mental state declined. Furthermore a bunch of my other dwarves were caged for reasons I do not know, and a couple of them went stark raving mad or slipped into melancholy from the isolation.  It has been a consistent feature of my fortresses that I have a few dwarves that are constantly depressed and violent, and nothing seems to improve their state. I can\u2019t kill them because it makes me feel bad. Troublingly, a factor in the development of this phenomenon seems to be acquiring a disability. One of my murderous dwarves has apparently permanent nervous system damage and has lost the ability to stand, and I suspect that his inability to move quickly between areas to meet his needs helped precipitate the development of misery. It seems like the dwarves would be clever enough to construct mobility aids beyond crutches.  Most of my dwarves are stressed because of unmet needs, and I have been wringing my brain over how to convince the dwarves to meet them. For example most of them are stressed by the need to pray to one or more of their gods, but I already have temple complexes established for those gods!!! Sometimes they are stressed over not praying to their god while standing in the temple to another god. I\u2019m thinking of putting an array of levers in each temple and telling dwarves to pull them in order to make dwarves visit the temples regularly.  The other major unmet needs are \u201cAcquire object\u201d and \u201cBe extravagant,\u201d which is a source of total perplexment for me, because there is high quality jewelry and items everywhere. I have been trying to encourage them to pick up items by making finished goods stockpiles for them to fill everywhere, but it doesn\u2019t seem to help.  Many dwarves also have a need to \u201cCraft object/Be creative,\u201d which I don\u2019t know how to fix either, because it takes like, a whole week in-game for anyone to pick up a crafting job assigned at a workshop. Everyone wants to \u201ccraft object\u201d nobody wants to stop \u201csocializing\u201d and craft the object.  Since dwarves like waterfalls so much, I have a waterfall going through my fortress that drains into the caves below, and the area where it drains into grates has a well and soap stockpile and I\u2019ve designated it a meeting area. I also have 4 separate taverns each with musical instruments.  In order to run so many raids, i have to have a large number of militias. Being in militias seems to initially boost mental health and then cause negative mental health impacts, so I am forced to rotate dwarves in and out of the militias; I regularly disband squads and re-form them with approximately half experienced dwarves and half new recruits. Setting them to train does virtually nothing to develop their skills, but it does make them keep their armor on, so I have set them to train pretty much constantly.  I wish I hadn\u2019t raided and destroyed the necromancer tower so soon in the save; the undead hordes were great target practice for my military.  Being at war with every elf civilization has a similar effect, since there are ambushes, but the trouble is, I\u2019m also at war with the goblin civilizations. Last night, a goblin siege started in the middle of an elf raid, which meant my military had to fight off both at once. Around 20 dwarves were killed, including one of my Legendary fighters. The rest were pretty severely wounded.  The hospitals were full of patients, and then I realized I had fallen victim to the dreaded supply chain disruption. Despite having a constantly running soap industry, I was completely out of soap.  A common source of supply chain distributions in my fortress is my permanently depressed dwarves, which regularly topple workshops causing work orders to be destroyed. At some point my lye making work order had gone to be with Jesus, and I hadn\u2019t had soap in a long time. I quickly loaded up lots of orders to make lye, but even marking orders as top priority doesn\u2019t make them happen much faster, as dwarves are always doing important shit like \u201cSocialize\u201d and \u201cPen/pasture some fucking baby gosling that wandered downstairs\u201d and \u201cListen to Poetry\u201d in the middle of a crisis.  (Cleaning raw fish and collecting webs in particular are more important to dwarves during an emergency situation than anything else in the world, which is why both of those activities are restricted).  I ended up canceling basically every other work order in the fortress to try to get someone, out of the 300 dwarves in my fortress, to work on making soap, but as soon as the soap was made, it was appropriated to clean up random blood puddles on the floor. By the time ANY soap made it into the hospitals, everyone had infected wounds, and no one could be bothered to clean them, because it was more important to do some random chore or mope around.  In other news, I\u2019ve had to install stairs next to the trees in the fruit gathering zone, because the dwarves keep removing stepladders while other dwarves are up in the trees, causing them to get stuck up there and starve/thirst to death.",

Amethyst Care is currently a project based in Trinity College Dublin that is working on developing an AI-powered voice assistant for people with mobility issues, such as Parkinson\u2019s. \nThe product comes with a range of features, including continuous monitoring of vital signs, medication and appointment reminders, emergency alerts and real-time updates for family and healthcare professionals. Just last week, Amethyst Care\u00a0raised more than \u20ac500,000 from Enterprise Ireland and now aims to begin trials by January 2025, with eyes set on the US. \nCarrick Therapeutics\nBased at NovaUCD in Dublin, Carrick Therapeutics is an oncology-focused biopharma start-up aiming to discover and develop highly differentiated therapies for the treatment of cancers. It was co-founded by Dr Elaine Sullivan, a molecular virologist with extensive experience across big names in pharma, including AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly.

        "url": "https://www.libfails.co/trump-leading-harris-after-biden-steps-down-poll/",
        "summary": "A recent survey brings favorable news for former President Donald Trump, just days after President Joe Biden withdrew his bid for re-election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. According to a CNN survey, 49 percent of respondents supported Trump, while 46 percent backed Harris. The poll was conducted by SSRS. \n\n\n\nThe survey took place between July 22-23, shortly after Biden announced he was stepping down from his re-election campaign. The poll included registered voters who had previously participated in CNN surveys in April and June, where Trump held a 6-point lead over Biden. Newsmax reported key findings from the poll: 64% believe Republicans have a better chance of winning the presidency in 2024 if Trump is the party\u2019s nominee.50% of Harris supporters said their vote is more in support of her than against Trump, compared to 37% of Biden\u2019s supporters who expressed their vote was mainly to support the president.74% of Trump supporters said their vote is to express support for Trump rather than opposition to Harris.Among Harris supporters under 45, 43% say their vote is more in support of her than against Trump, an increase from 28% of Biden voters in that age group who felt similarly in June.Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters are divided over whether the next nominee should continue Biden\u2019s policies (53%) or take the country in a new direction (47%).88% of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters believe Republicans have a better chance of winning with Trump at the top of the ticket.Elon Musk, X platform boss and billionaire entrepreneur, quickly criticized Harris following Biden\u2019s endorsement. \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden wrote in a letter posted on social media and elsewhere online on Sunday. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\" Shortly after, he endorsed Harris. \"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\" the president said. \"And it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made. \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats \u2014 it\u2019s time to come together and beat Trump. Let\u2019s do this,\" he added. Musk then posted an older video clip of Harris chairing a meeting where she introduces herself: \"Good afternoon. I want to welcome these leaders for coming in to have this very important discussion about some of the most pressing issues of our time. I am Kamala Harris. My pronouns are \u2018she\u2019 and \u2018her.\u2019 I am a woman sitting at the table wearing a blue suit.\" In his post, Musk wrote: \"Imagine 4 years of this...\" Imagine 4 years of this \u2026 https://t.co/gFwWAv15Qx \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 22, 2024\nThe remarks were from a \"roundtable with disability advocates,\" according to a White House transcript, held on July 26, 2022. Others also mocked Harris. At the time, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado posted on X: \"Kamala Harris just introduced herself with she/her pronouns at an official event. She then clarified that she was a \u2018woman\u2019 sitting at the table wearing a blue suit. This is what happens when your speechwriter quits and you hang around with Geriatric Joe too long.\" Fox News host Sean Hannity, during a Monday show segment, claimed Harris is most guilty of covering for Biden as his mental health and acuity declined over their nearly four-year term. The segment featured Dr. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician and now GOP congressman from Texas, who knew Biden well while serving as then-President Barack Obama\u2019s personal doctor, along with longtime journalist Charlie Hurt, who directly blamed Harris for hiding Biden\u2019s condition from the country for years.",

Voting is maintenance. It\u2019s like doing the dishes or cleaning the leaves out of the gutters. You\u2019re never going to get to a point where you are Done and Never Have To Do It Again (alas,) because time will continue to pass and you will continue to eat meals and the trees will continue to drop leaves into your gutters and right wingers will continue to submit bad bills to every session of congress.  You\u2019ll never be done with maintenance. But if you don\u2019t do that maintenance, your situation can and definitely will get Worse Finally a take on the \u2018vote or else\u2019 shit I can vibe with. It\u2019s currently like showering with dysphoria- miserable and annoying with no real positive outcome past the current state not rapidly getting worse, but that\u2019s better than the alternative of things rapidly getting worse",

        "summary": "World News \n \nWorld News - Be The First That Gets The Latest News \n  \n \n\n\nWeight loss drugs have drawn investor interest and shaken up other sectors in the past year or so. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly were two early winners of this trend, as their drugs dominate the weight loss drug market. Yuri Khodjamirian, fund manager at Tema ETFs, said both companies are a \u201cvery powerful duopoly.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s obviously going to be room ins such a big market. The estimates currently are about $130 billion from Goldman Sachs. We think it\u2019s going to be multiples of that,\u201d he told CNBC Pro Talks last week. Khodjamirian believes there\u2019s room for at least three players in this space. \u201cI think the market is big enough to sustain three to four players, even at the market caps that are out there right now, but the market\u2019s trying to figure out who that third or fourth player is, and a big breakthrough could be oral GLP-1s,\u201d he said. He was referring to GLP-1, a class of weight loss drugs that was originally developed as a treatment for diabetes. GLP-1 is a hormone released in the gut that stimulates insulin secretion, slows the emptying of the stomach and communicates to the brain a feeling of satisfaction. Stocks to watch Khodjamirian named Amgen , which is developing an injectable drug and other products for obesity. He also pointed out some biotech names with potential but that investors have to be careful about. One of them is Carmot , which was acquired by pharmaceutical firm Roche last year, he noted. He also named smaller biotech firms such as Zealand Pharma and Viking Therapeutics . \u201cThese companies are early biotechs that are developing data. They\u2019re a lot more risky than the bigger ones who already have drugs on the market,\u201d Khodjamirian said. \u201cAnd therefore, you have to just be very careful with making investments in such companies. So a diversified portfolio is probably the best way to go,\u201d he said. Tema ETFs offers actively managed exchange-traded funds, with a focus on health care and life sciences. Khodjamirian is also the chief investment officer of Tema ETFs and manages its Monopolies & Oligopolies ETF , which looks to provide investors with long-term growth through companies that operate in monopolistic industry structures. Khodjamirian highlighted three ETFs his firm manages that are in the health-care industry: the Tema GLP-1, Obesity & Cardiometabolic ETF; the Tema Oncology ETF; and the Tema Neuroscience and Mental Health ETF. He said there\u2019s a \u201cvaluation opportunity\u201d in biotech stocks at the moment, but warned of risks. \u201cSmaller companies in the biotech space are difficult to pick. You have to really know what you\u2019re doing, and \u2026 in most of our biotech portfolios, we have 50 stocks, we don\u2019t own more than 1%, 2% in some of these companies because of these risks, they could go to zero,\u201d he said. However, there are \u201ca lot\u201d of innovations happening in biotech, and \u201cloads of them\u201d are trading below the value of the cash on their balance sheets, Khodjamirian said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a valuation opportunity out there,\u201d he said.",

        "summary": "Trigger Warning: This post discusses topics including mental health struggles, trauma, and suicidal thoughts. Reader discretion is advised. \n\n\n\n There are painful truths that I want to out, demons I want to exorcise, and I wish I could put it all to rest. Yet, something deep inside is telling me this isn\u2019t a good idea. Lately, I\u2019ve found comfort in being single for the foreseeable future, if not forever. After years of undiagnosed bipolar disorder, chaotic relationships, and playing emotional tennis with two men while going through absolute hell, I fell into fast romances when what I truly needed was mental health intervention. Finally, I\u2019m learning to like myself. I understand now that I can give myself everything I need; I don\u2019t need a man or a relationship to make me feel good. That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t have desires or yearnings\u2014of course, I do. But while I\u2019m supported and sorting my life out for the first time ever, it\u2019s just not in my best interests to seek solace with someone else, and I don\u2019t particularly want to. This is something I\u2019m reminded of whenever I give in and re-download countless gay apps on my phone. \n\n\n\nI knew I was gay at a very young age. I was on webcam chatrooms way before I should have been and accrued quite the list of contacts on the likes of AIM, Yahoo Messenger, and later Windows Live Messenger. I didn\u2019t know how to talk to just one person and stay loyal. I\u2019d been groomed into believing that having everyone want a piece of me was a good thing, a mindset that would follow me into the real world. Inappropriate relationships left, right, and centre led to being labelled a slut and shamed. But what I needed was someone to grab my hand and drag me away from what I believed to be perfectly normal. Just because I was doing it to myself didn\u2019t mean it was what I wanted or should have been doing. People treated me like a petulant young person when, in reality, I was so fucking lost.",

It causes us to have unexplained and often irrational emotions (angry, depressed, etc) when we feel misunderstood or rejected. It typically happens instantly. For example: A close friend or relative asks you to stop clicking your pen, and you start uncontrollably crying right after they ask you to stop. These feelings are often incredibly intense, debilitating, and painful Medication - Many people may be put on medication for their ADHD. It may help, or it might not. Medication is not for everyone. Some people find that fidgeting or stimming helps more, and others find that therapy appointments are more beneficial ADHD affects your school performance, your overall mental health, relationships with others, and so much more.

I\u2019ve been slowly paying back my bills, but I guess someone got fed up with me and the bank ended up taking all my money for this month.

I played it off and left the store in a panic trying to figure out why I didn\u2019t have five dollars, and I saw that the bank drained my account. My face must have given me away, because the cashier ran out of the store with the bathbomb I\u2019d failed to purchase and just put his hand on my shoulder and told me it was ok. I almost didn\u2019t take it, I was so shocked, and asked if he was sure, and he said \u201cit\u2019s just a bathbomb\u201d. \n\nI got into my car and started to sob, not knowing how I am going to eat and pay the rest of my bills this month, and I had moments where I wanted to drive somewhere and not return - but my mind kept coming back to this person who showed me such kindness and generosity, a stranger, and they in no way were required to help me. \n\nI\u2019m still emotional over it; and I plan on thanking him when I get the bandwidth to do so. Let this be a message to show people small kindnesses when you can, because you may well be saving a life and giving hope. ",

He has been getting violent in his room over video games slamming and punching and breaking things. He refuses every family outing and stayed in the car when I had us go to the park for a family night and refuses to join us at the aquarium, pool, anywhere fun. Also, when I entered his room he physically attacked me when I was trying to stop one of these video game induced rage fits. \n\nNow on the good side he earns high grades, he doesn't do drugs or anything off he just stays in his room. He is usually quiet and well mannered outside of the video game rage, and very well spoken. He is good with his other siblings and has a sense of humor where he tries to make us laugh. He otherwise doesn't have red flags all the time. My main complaint has been the games and anti social behavior until very recent where he did lash out on me. All of this led me to just check the phone and while I try to give him autonomy and space and respect I disagree with his choices right now especially the anti-social behaviors. \n\nThe phone was disturbing. Just disturbing. I am still processing the information I obtained and I don't know where to begin or how to get the help that might be needed here. \n\nHe speaks to one friend and he tells the friend he is self conscious about every aspect of himself. He doesn't like his hair, his body hair even, his private areas, his teeth, his finger nails, his voice all things about himself he labels as inadequate. He said he feels self destructive but he doesn't act on this he said in the texts.\n\nHe is very clingy to this one friend he asks when and where he is going and when he will be back.

I laugh and I can currently eat and I have hobbies, etc. \n\nBut every day I just feel a deep heaviness on me, like every happy or normal moment is somehow overshadowed by a deep urge to kill myself. I literally think about it constantly. I think about how i\u2019d do it, how badly I crave it - I think about how much easier it would be to give up. Yet I continue to live my life normally? I continue to do normal things. I\u2019m actively living but passively always suicidal.\n\nIt\u2019s become more comfortable to think about killing myself rather than living and worrying about the future, you know? The fact that I have a semi normal life while still feeling this way just makes the urges stronger. It feels like a waste of a life when people are suffering much worse than I am and I have it so nice comparatively. \n\nI constantly want to kill myself but i\u2019m actively living. It genuinely just feels like i\u2019m waiting for a switch to go off, when I\u2019ll just decide now is the time to end it.\n\nSometimes the feeling passes but it always comes back. It has come back after therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, etc. It\u2019s especially bad now, idk why. Anyone else feel this way? \n",
